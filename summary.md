# WirthForge Wiki Summary

This repository collects foundational documents and technical references for the WirthForge project. It now includes:

- A 60 Hz boot smoke test under `tests/WF-TECH-001/`.
- A runnable "Hello, Energy" example in `code/WF-TECH-001/reference/`.

These additions provide a starting point for validating system timing and exploring energy-focused code samples.
