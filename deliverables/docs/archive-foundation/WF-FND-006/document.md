**Document ID**: WF-FND-006  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Category**: Foundation (Governance & Evolution)  
**Priority**: P0 (Platform integrity & controlled evolution)  

## Executive Summary

The Living System Governance & Evolution Framework establishes WIRTHFORGE as a continuously evolving platform while preserving its foundational principles. This framework provides the constitutional foundation for all future changes, ensuring that innovation serves the core vision rather than compromising it. Through formal change governance, sandboxed experimentation, and comprehensive audit trails, the system can adapt and grow while maintaining its magical user experience and local-first architecture.

## Core Objective

Establish a governance and evolution framework that allows the WIRTHFORGE platform to grow and adapt over time without ever compromising its founding principles. This document defines how changes are proposed, vetted, and integrated into the living system. It covers strict change control mechanisms, sandboxed experimental features, the process for introducing new user journeys and AI models, schema versioning, continuous self-measurement via metrics, and comprehensive audit trails.

## Embracing a Living System

WIRTHFORGE is not static software; it's a continuously evolving ecosystem. Like a living organism, it must adapt to new ideas, user needs, and technological advances to stay healthy. This creates a fundamental tension between innovation and preservation of core principles.

### Guardrails vs. Freedom

The platform must balance the excitement of new features with the responsibility of preserving the core vision. Without governance, changes could dilute or break the magical experience; with overly rigid control, the system could stagnate.

### Living Constitution

Just as WF-FND-001 laid out the vision, this framework ensures every future change honors that vision. Users are co-creators in this living system, but within a structured process that maintains integrity.

**Garden Analogy**: Just as a garden grows under the care of a diligent gardener, WIRTHFORGE's features and capabilities must be cultivated with intention. New seeds (features) are welcome, but weeds (chaotic changes) are not. This governance serves as the gardening guide – ensuring that every addition blossoms without strangling the existing life.

## Inviolable Core Principles

These core platform principles must never be violated by any evolution. They form the foundation of all governance rules – essentially the immutable laws that all new changes are checked against.

### Core Invariants Configuration

```yaml
core_invariants:
  local_core: true            # Core runs on user hardware, always
  allow_docker: false         # No Docker containers in core flows
  target_frame_rate: 60       # Must sustain 60fps visuals
  energy_visualization: true  # All compute reflected as Energy
  ui_presence: true           # No core feature is invisible to user
  consciousness_emergent: true # AI behaviors must emerge, not be hard-coded
```

### Detailed Principles

1. **Local-Core Enforcement**: All primary computations and experiences run on the user's local machine. No update can mandate cloud dependency or externalize core processing (web features remain optional enhancements).

2. **No Docker / Native Execution**: The platform will not require Docker or similar containers for core modules, ensuring simplicity and trust in local execution. New integrations must work with native, lightweight methods.

3. **Real-Time Constraint (60 FPS Magic)**: The interactive experience must remain smooth and real-time. Any new feature must operate within the tight performance budget (16.7ms per frame) or gracefully degrade.

4. **Energy-Truth Visualization**: Every computational process remains represented as Energy in the UI – "what you compute is what you see." New modules cannot bypass the energy system without generating proportional energy particles.

5. **UI-Required Interface**: All core interactions must surface through the WIRTHFORGE UI. Features should not run silently in the background without visual/audio indication.

6. **Emergence, Not Preprogramming**: No new feature should "fake" consciousness or outcomes. The system's evolving behaviors must continue to emerge from underlying mechanics and user interaction.

## Change Governance Process

### Governance Workflow

The formal process by which any new feature, improvement, or significant change is proposed, evaluated, and either accepted or rejected.

#### Proposal Stage
Any substantial change starts with a Change Proposal document outlining:
- Feature description and benefits
- Analysis of core principle compliance
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Performance impact evaluation
- User experience implications

#### Governance Board
A small core team responsible for evaluating proposals with multidisciplinary review:
- **Technical Architect**: Checks performance and security
- **Design Lead**: Checks UX consistency
- **Lore Keeper**: Checks thematic alignment
- **Community Representative**: Ensures user benefit

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Alignment with vision and principles
- Technical feasibility
- Impact on performance
- Complexity introduced
- Benefit to user experience
- Testability and auditability

#### Decision Outcomes
- **Approved**: Feature moves to implementation
- **Approved with Changes**: Requires modifications before implementation
- **Deferred**: Good idea but not appropriate timing
- **Rejected**: Does not meet criteria or violates principles

#### Version Tagging
Approved features follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- **Patch**: Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Minor**: New functionality without breaking changes
- **Major**: Breaking changes or core principle alterations (extremely rare)

## Safe Sandboxing & Experimentation

### Local Sandbox Instances

WIRTHFORGE can spawn experimental modules or features in sandbox mode - a segregated execution context that runs locally but is isolated from the primary UI and state.

### Sandbox Policies

#### Read but Don't Write
- **Read Access**: Subscribe to real-time data streams (energy pulses, user prompts, model outputs)
- **Write Restrictions**: Cannot publish to main UI or alter persistent state
- **Isolation**: Render to developer console or hidden debug pane only

#### No Persistent Side-Effects
- All sandbox activities are ephemeral unless promoted
- No saving to user profile or permanent rewards
- No overwriting of canonical data
- Guarantees that experiments cannot corrupt user journey

#### Resource Limits
- Constrained memory and compute time per frame
- Automatic pause/termination if limits exceeded
- Ensures main experience never lags due to background experiments

#### Security Boundaries
- Treated as untrusted until proven
- Prevented from unauthorized system calls
- No network access unless specifically allowed
- No file writes outside temp directory

### Sandbox Policy Configuration

```typescript
interface SandboxPolicy {
  canReadEvents: string[];    // e.g., ["EnergyStream", "UserPrompt", "ModelOutput"]
  canWriteEvents: string[];   // e.g., [] (none allowed to main bus)
  allowUIRender: boolean;     // false (sandbox cannot draw in main UI)
  allowPersistence: boolean;  // false (no saving data)
  maxMemoryMB: number;        // e.g., 128 MB
  maxExecutionTimeMs: number; // e.g., 5 ms per frame slice
  networkAccess: "none";      // or "restricted"/"full" if needed
}
```

### Promotion to Core

Staged rollout process for graduating sandbox features:
1. **Sandbox Testing**: Isolated experimentation with real data
2. **Staging UI**: Visible only to beta testers or developers
3. **Limited Rollout**: Gradual exposure to broader user base
4. **Full Integration**: Complete merger into core codebase and UI

## Evolving Paths and Models

### New Aesthetic Paths ("Doors")

Adding new user journey paths beyond the original three (Forge, Scholar, Sage) requires comprehensive review:

#### Mythology & Design Review
- Creative team crafts complementary mythology
- Must not conflict with existing lore
- All paths remain equally valid and rewarding
- Harmony of distinct, equally empowered journeys

#### Visual/Experience Assets
- New UI elements, energy color palettes, particle effects
- Standard asset pipeline: concept → design → prototype → polish
- Quality and consistency with WIRTHFORGE visual design system
- No placeholder or low-quality assets in production

#### Technical Integration
- Graceful handling of additional path categories
- Thorough testing of path-specific logic
- Onboarding flows, achievements, community grouping
- All systems must handle extra categories

#### Community Impact Assessment
- Community sentiment evaluation
- Ensuring existing users don't feel neglected
- Clear communication and beta programs
- Balanced attention across all paths

### New AI Models

Adding support for new AI models requires governance due to performance, energy calibration, and experience impacts:

#### Local-First Compatibility
- Must run natively on local setup
- No Docker or cloud-only inference requirements
- Bridging solutions must fit no-cloud, no-Docker stance

#### Energy Calibration
- Define compute-to-energy translation
- Ensure fairness across different models
- Calibration phase in sandbox environment
- Measure token throughput and resource usage

#### UI Representation
- New visualization modules for unique capabilities
- Alignment with core visual language
- Energy frame integration for new output types
- Consistent with empowerment ethos

#### Performance Impact Testing
- Sandbox testing for performance implications
- Dynamic quality reduction if needed
- Warnings for resource-intensive models
- Maintain real-time thresholds

## Schema Versioning & Data Integrity

### Event Schema as Contracts

WIRTHFORGE subsystems communicate via structured events that act as contracts between producers and consumers. Schema changes must be carefully managed to prevent breaking these contracts.

### Semantic Version Tags

Every significant schema includes version information:

```json
// Version 1
{ "event": "EnergyBurst", "version": 1, "amount": 50, "source": "Lightning" }

// Version 2 (breaking change)
{ "event": "EnergyBurst", "version": 2, "raw_amount": 40, "bonus_amount": 10, "source": "Lightning" }
```

### Full Cascade on Major Changes

Breaking schema changes require coordinated updates of all producers and consumers:
- **Planning Phase**: Identify all affected components
- **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive regression testing
- **Deployment Phase**: Synchronized rollout
- **Validation Phase**: Verify system integrity

### Migration Paths

- **Runtime Events**: Backward compatibility during deprecation period
- **Persistent Data**: Migration scripts or auto-migrate code
- **Deprecation Policy**: Support old versions for defined periods
- **Communication**: Clear schedules for integrators and plugin developers

### Schema Handling Example

```python
def handle_energy_burst(event_json):
    if event_json.get("version", 1) == 1:
        data = EventV1(**event_json)
        total = data.amount
    elif event_json["version"] == 2:
        data = EventV2(**event_json)
        total = data.raw_amount + data.bonus_amount
    process_energy(total, data.source)
```

## Self-Monitoring Metrics & Adaptive Feedback

### Metrics-Driven Evolution

WIRTHFORGE continuously measures its vital signs to sense when things are going well or when adjustments are needed.

### Key Metrics Defined

#### Progression Rate
- Energy Units or XP per hour of active use
- Average days to level up
- Healthy range expectations (too fast = shallow, too slow = frustration)

#### Energy Visual Fidelity
- Ratio of energy particles to actual tokens processed
- User feedback ratings on visual experience
- Synchronization between computation and visualization

#### System Latency
- Time from user action to system response
- P95 latency targets (e.g., under 2 seconds for standard prompts)
- Network, model processing, compilation, and rendering times

#### Frame Rate Stability
- Average and worst-case frame render times
- Number of dropped frames per minute
- 60 FPS maintenance under normal conditions

#### Error Rates & Anomalies
- Module timeout and crash frequencies
- Orchestrator restart incidents
- Unusual uptick detection

### Metrics Schema

```yaml
metrics_snapshot:
  timestamp: 2025-08-13T00:00:00Z
  session_id: abc123
  progression_rate: 1.2   # levels per hour
  energy_fidelity: 0.95   # visual vs actual compute alignment
  avg_latency_ms: 1500    # 1.5 seconds
  p95_latency_ms: 2100    # 95th percentile
  avg_frame_rate: 60.0    # FPS
  frame_drops: 0          # frames below 30fps
  module_error_count: 0
```

### Orchestrator Adaptors

Real-time system adaptations based on metric thresholds:

#### Performance Protection
- Frame rate drops → reduce visual effects quality
- High latency → suggest faster models or optimizations
- Resource constraints → temporary feature limitations

#### Progression Balancing
- Low progression rate → increase energy rewards or highlight easier tasks
- Rapid progression → cap rewards to maintain balance
- Pattern detection → suggest optimizations or adaptations

#### Energy Calibration
- Visual lag detection → recalibrate particle generation
- GPU throttling → adjust effect physics
- Synchronization maintenance → real-time adjustments
