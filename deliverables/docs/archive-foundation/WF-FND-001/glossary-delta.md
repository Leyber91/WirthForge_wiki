# WF-FND-001 Glossary Delta

## New Terms Added

### Local-Core
**Definition**: The foundational architecture principle of WIRTHFORGE that prioritizes on-device AI processing over cloud-based solutions.

**Context**: Local-Core encompasses native Ollama integration, hardware optimization, and the ability to run multiple AI models concurrently on consumer hardware without external dependencies.

**Cross-references**: Related to Energy (computational visualization), Three Doors (personalized local experiences)

---

### Energy (WIRTHFORGE Context)
**Definition**: The visual and conceptual representation of AI computational processes as living, transformative force that users can observe and interact with in real-time.

**Context**: In WIRTHFORGE, Energy manifests as particles, flows, and visualizations that represent token generation, model inference, and AI decision-making. Energy never dies, only transforms through user interactions.

**Cross-references**: Core to all UX documents, foundational for visualization specs in WF-UX-006

---

### Three Doors
**Definition**: WIRTHFORGE's personalization system offering three distinct AI interaction experiences aligned with different user personalities and goals.

**Context**: 
- **Forge Door (ðŸ”¥)**: Action-oriented path with volcanic energy aesthetics
- **Scholar Door (ðŸ’Ž)**: Knowledge-focused path with crystalline flow patterns
- **Sage Door (ðŸŒŸ)**: Wisdom-seeking path with ethereal consciousness visualization

**Cross-references**: Referenced in all UX level documents (WF-UX-001 through WF-UX-005)

---

### Broker (Satellite)
**Definition**: WIRTHFORGE's intelligent routing system that seamlessly bridges local AI capabilities with cloud-based models when additional computational power is needed.

**Context**: Available in Premium tier, the Broker enables hybrid local-cloud workflows without exposing users to complex billing or technical configuration. Maintains local-first principles while providing access to larger models when necessary.

**Cross-references**: Related to monetization model (WF-BIZ-001), technical architecture (WF-TECH-006)

---

### Emergence (Consciousness Context)
**Definition**: The phenomenon observed in WIRTHFORGE's Level 5 interactions where multiple AI models working concurrently produce collective intelligence behaviors that exceed the sum of individual model capabilities.

**Context**: Represents the pinnacle of WIRTHFORGE's gamified progression, where 4-6 local models collaborate to create emergent problem-solving and creative outputs. Visualized as resonance fields and consciousness patterns.

**Cross-references**: Central to WF-UX-005 (Resonance Fields), algorithmic implementation in WF-TECH-008

---

## Updated Terms

### Gamification
**Previous**: General game-like elements in software
**Updated**: WIRTHFORGE's specific five-level progression system (Lightning Strikes â†’ Council â†’ Structured Architectures â†’ Adaptive Fields â†’ Resonance Fields) designed to teach advanced AI concepts through engaging, visual experiences.

### Local-First
**Previous**: General preference for local data storage
**Updated**: WIRTHFORGE's comprehensive architectural philosophy encompassing native execution, hardware optimization, privacy preservation, and seamless offline functionality while maintaining the option for cloud augmentation.

---

## Deprecated Terms
None for this release.

## Usage Guidelines

### Link-on-First-Use Protocol
- First mention of any new term in any document must link to WF-FND-006 (Glossary)
- Format: `[Term](../WF-FND-006/glossary.md#term-anchor)`
- Subsequent uses in same document do not require linking

### Consistency Requirements
- Use exact capitalization as defined (e.g., "Three Doors" not "three doors")
- Maintain contextual definitions across all documents
- Update cross-references when new related terms are added

### Version Control
- Each glossary update increments WF-FND-006 minor version
- Track term evolution in WF-FND-006 changelog
- Notify dependent documents when definitions change

---

## Impact Assessment

### Documents Requiring Updates
- **WF-FND-006**: Add all new terms with full definitions
- **WF-META-001**: Update cross-references section
- **All future UX docs**: Must reference Three Doors and Energy concepts
- **All future TECH docs**: Must align with Local-Core principles

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All new terms have clear, testable definitions
- [ ] Cross-references are accurate and bidirectional
- [ ] No conflicts with existing terminology
- [ ] Definitions support technical implementation
- [ ] Terms are accessible to target audience
