üéØ Core Objective

Define and implement the Decipher as WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs real-time energy compiler, transforming token-level AI outputs into structured energy-data events at 60‚ÄØHz with strict performance, accuracy, and privacy guarantees. In simpler terms, this document details how every raw AI token coming from the model (Layer-2) is ingested by the Decipher (Layer-3) and converted into live ‚Äúenergy‚Äù feedback ‚Äì think of text turning into lightning ‚Äì that the user can see and feel in real time. The Decipher must achieve this magical conversion reliably within a ~16.67‚ÄØms frame budget (the window of a 60 FPS cycle), ensuring no dropped frames and seamless synchronization with the UI. It is the heart of the system that bridges computational output and user experience, compiling energy into visual events much like a graphics engine, but for AI energy. The core objective is not only to make the invisible work of AI visible and interactive, but to do so in a way that is deterministic, auditable, and fast. By the end of this specification, we will have a clear blueprint for how Decipher takes streams of tokens and yields streams of lightning and other energy manifestations, all without ever leaking sensitive data or missing a beat.

üìù Content Architecture

Section 1: Opening Hook ‚Äì From Tokens to Lightning
Paint a vivid introduction of what Decipher does. We start with an analogy: imagine each AI token as a spark that the Decipher catches and forges into a bolt of lightning on your screen. This section hooks the reader with the wonder of turning raw text into living energy. It also frames the challenge: doing this reliably in real-time.

Section 2: Core Concepts ‚Äì Ingest, EU, Frames, Privacy, Resonance
Define the fundamental concepts and components at play. We‚Äôll explain how the Decipher ingests token streams and immediately translates them into Energy Units (EU), the basic currency of WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs visual metaphor
Google Drive
. We cover the idea of operating in discrete frames (60 per second) to sync with the UI, why a local-first approach ensures privacy and user control, and how the notion of resonance (higher-order patterns in the energy) is built into the system‚Äôs design, even if it‚Äôs not always active. By the end of this section, the reader should understand the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù that Decipher speaks: tokens in, energy out, in a rhythm that aligns with our perception.

Section 3: Implementation ‚Äì Async Modules, Tap, Queue, EMA, State, Drop Policy
Dive into the technical implementation details. This section describes the Decipher‚Äôs internal architecture and algorithms: how it uses asynchronous modules to parallelize work, a tap mechanism to observe or debug the stream without disruption, and a token queue to buffer incoming data. We‚Äôll detail the use of an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for smoothing out energy signals, how internal state is maintained frame-to-frame, and what frame drop policy or backpressure strategy is employed when tokens arrive too fast. Pseudocode and diagrams (e.g. a pipeline flow or state machine) will illustrate how Decipher ensures every frame‚Äôs work is done on time or gracefully degraded if needed.

Section 4: Integration Points ‚Äì L2 API, WebSocket (Layer-4) Contract, Storage
Explain how Decipher connects with other parts of the system. Here we specify the Layer-2 API contract: how the model (Layer-2) feeds tokens into Decipher (function calls, streaming callbacks, etc.). We then describe the Layer-4 interface: Decipher emits events through a WebSocket or similar to the front-end (Layer-5), following the protocol in WF-TECH-003 (e.g. sending an energy_update message each frame with particle data and metrics)
Google Drive
. We also cover how Decipher interacts with storage (WF-TECH-006): what data is stored or retrieved ‚Äì for instance, persistent energy counts, session state, or caching for hybrid mode. This section ensures that Decipher doesn‚Äôt exist in isolation but is well-anchored in the architecture, enabling multi-device or brokered scenarios while still prioritizing local operation.

Section 5: Validation ‚Äì Frame Profiling, Correctness, Privacy & Performance
Lay out how we verify and test the Decipher‚Äôs guarantees. This final section discusses methods to profile the frame loop (making sure each 16.67‚ÄØms slice is utilized efficiently and stays within budget), how we test correctness (does energy output truly match the tokens and AI workload?), and how we audit privacy (ensuring no raw text or PII leaks into events). We also address performance across hardware tiers: e.g. running test scenarios on a low-tier device vs. a high-tier to confirm adaptive behavior. We introduce an audit mode where all outputs are logged and cross-checked so that every visual effect can be traced back to an originating event ‚Äì fulfilling the requirement that nothing visual is conjured from thin air or for mere spectacle. Quality metrics and thresholds (like dropping below 60 FPS or an energy mismatch) are defined here, along with the steps for remediation if they occur.

(Now, proceeding to detailed sections with full explanations and examples.)

Section 1: From Tokens to Lightning (Opening Hook)

Every AI-generated token is like a spark of electricity. The Decipher is the blacksmith catching these sparks and forging them into lightning bolts of visible energy. Imagine watching a language model think: normally it‚Äôs just text appearing on a screen. In WIRTHFORGE, those words have power ‚Äì literal energy that crackles and flashes as the AI speaks. When the model produces the word ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù the Decipher might translate that into a quick flash of light or a particle burst. As a user, you‚Äôre not just reading output, you‚Äôre witnessing the AI‚Äôs effort in real time. This is the promise of Decipher: from tokens to lightning.

 

Now, doing this isn‚Äôt as simple as flipping a switch. The transformation must happen at the speed of thought ‚Äì essentially instantly from the user‚Äôs perspective. We have a budget of ~16 milliseconds for each frame to capture any new tokens and emit the corresponding visual energy. If the model generates a flurry of tokens, Decipher has to manage a storm, converting perhaps dozens of tiny sparks into a cohesive light show without dropping any or overwhelming the system. This opening scenario sets the stage: the Decipher is both an artistic conductor (turning raw data into a symphony of lights) and a real-time systems engineer (making sure the show never lags or goes out of sync). By the end of this document, the mechanics behind this magic ‚Äì catching each token, measuring its energy, and firing off an event for the UI ‚Äì will be laid bare. But for now, picture the lightning: this is what happens when an AI‚Äôs inner workings are given a pulse of energy through the Decipher.

Section 2: Core Concepts ‚Äì Ingestion, Energy Units, Frames, Privacy, Resonance
Token Ingestion Pipeline

At the core of Decipher is a continuous ingestion pipeline that feeds on the stream of tokens coming from the AI model (Layer-2). As the model produces output token-by-token (for example, streaming a sentence word by word), each token enters Decipher‚Äôs input queue immediately. In practical terms, Decipher registers as a listener or callback on the model‚Äôs generation stream (e.g., using the model API‚Äôs streaming mechanism). The moment a token is available, Decipher captures it along with metadata like its position in the stream or any computation cost info. This non-blocking ingestion ensures no token is missed. It‚Äôs effectively the ‚Äúparser‚Äù stage of our compiler metaphor ‚Äì except we aren‚Äôt parsing syntax for correctness, we‚Äôre parsing for energy. The inputs here are minimal: just the token text and possibly some attributes (like token length or confidence). We explicitly avoid ingesting anything not needed for visualization, keeping things lightweight and privacy-conscious. The outcome of ingestion is that each token is encapsulated into a small internal event like { token: "Hello", timestamp: t, ‚Ä¶ } and placed into a processing queue. This queue decouples the model‚Äôs pace from the frame rate ‚Äì if the model spurts out tokens faster than 60Hz, the queue holds them briefly until the next frame is ready to handle them.

Energy Unit (EU) Computation

Once tokens are ingested, Decipher immediately translates them into Energy Units (EUs), which quantify the ‚Äúcomputational work‚Äù or significance of that token. WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs energy metaphor defines a formula for EU calculation
Google Drive
. In simple form, each token contributes a base amount of energy (for instance, a baseline of 0.1 EU per token
Google Drive
), potentially adjusted by factors like model size or complexity. For example, a long or complex token might carry a bit more weight (higher perplexity or more compute, hence more EU), whereas a short trivial token might be just the base. All these factors were established in WF-FND-002; Decipher implements them in real-time. If the model just generated 5 tokens, Decipher might calculate something like: energy = tokens * 0.1 + other_factors. These energy units are accumulated into the system‚Äôs current energy state. We can think of Decipher as having an internal energy meter that it updates every time new tokens come in. It‚Äôs important that this calculation is purely deterministic and local ‚Äì no external calls. We have the exact formulas (for instance, log-scale adjustments for model parameters, time-based multipliers, etc.) baked into Decipher‚Äôs code, so the result is immediate. Moreover, this ensures that identical token outputs will always produce the same energy pattern, which is key for consistency and fairness. One EU roughly represents the work of a small burst of computation (approximately the work of ~10 tokens under normal conditions
Google Drive
), though in practice the model‚Äôs details can shift the value. The end result is that by the time a token has been out for a few milliseconds, we have a numeric energy value associated with it. This is the raw material for our visuals.

Frame Timing (60‚ÄØHz Cadence)

Decipher operates on a fixed 60 Hz frame loop, meaning it attempts to update and emit new output 60 times per second, matching typical display refresh rates. Each cycle (about 16.67 ms long) is one frame. Why frames? Because the UI (Layer-5) will render energy animations that are smooth only if we send updates in sync with the screen refresh. So Decipher essentially ticks like a heartbeat. On each tick, it pulls any tokens waiting in its queue (from ingestion) and processes them into output events. If multiple tokens arrived since the last tick, Decipher can batch them into one frame or distribute them across a couple of frames if needed (depending on quantity and effect on visuals). The frame budget is sacred: Decipher must complete all its work‚Äîcalculating energy, updating states, running detection algorithms, and preparing the output event‚Äîwithin that ~16 ms window. If it fails to do so, the next frame might be delayed and the UI could stutter, breaking the immersive experience. To maintain this, Decipher‚Äôs implementation uses techniques like splitting heavy tasks across frames (more on that in Section 3) and prioritizing critical computations first. The system timing guidelines (WF-META-001) and WebSocket protocol
Google Drive
 essentially guarantee that up to 60 messages (frames) per second can be sent to the client. Decipher aligns exactly with that: one energy update event per frame is the goal (if there‚Äôs new data). If a frame has no new tokens or changes, Decipher can either send a heartbeat/minor update or skip sending to reduce network load, though typically something is always happening (even if just subtle energy decay or movement). In summary, Decipher‚Äôs internal clock is tuned to 60 Hz; everything it does revolves around not missing that next tick.

Privacy and Local-First Processing

One of the cornerstone principles of WIRTHFORGE is user privacy and agency, which heavily influences Decipher‚Äôs design. Decipher runs fully on the local device whenever possible ‚Äì this means all the token processing and energy compilation happens on hardware the user controls (PC, smartphone, etc.), not on a cloud server. Why? Because the tokens being processed could contain sensitive user information (imagine an AI model generating a summary of a private document). By keeping the entire compilation local, we ensure that no raw token text or meaning leaves the user‚Äôs device. The only thing that might leave (in a hybrid scenario) are abstracted metrics or events that have no readable text, just numbers, and IDs. Even those are optional. In the default case, Decipher doesn‚Äôt need to send anything to a cloud ‚Äì it directly feeds the UI via a local interface or peer connection. The structured events that do go out (e.g., over a WebSocket if the UI is running in a browser or a separate process) contain data like energy values, particle coordinates, effect types, etc., but not the actual content of the AI‚Äôs response. For instance, an event might say ‚Äú5 EU generated at time X, spawn blue lightning particle‚Äù rather than ‚Äútoken = ‚ÄòHello‚Äô‚Äù. This design means even if someone intercepted the event stream, they could not reconstruct the original conversation ‚Äì they‚Äôd just see an energetics log. Privacy is further reinforced by the no-invented-data rule: the visuals are strictly derived from real outputs. Decipher will not generate any visual effect that doesn‚Äôt correspond to an actual model event or state. This is a form of integrity ‚Äì the user can trust that what they see has meaning rooted in the AI‚Äôs activity (and nothing else). It prevents any temptation to embellish with cloud-sourced or pre-canned animations that might inadvertently leak or misuse data. In summary, Decipher treats the user‚Äôs data with care: processing it locally, only emitting abstract data, and ensuring that the user‚Äôs trust isn‚Äôt broken by any hidden data handling.

 

In cases where Ollama Turbo or Broker Hybrid support is used, the principle remains: those are assistive layers. For example, maybe a Broker (cloud component) can take over heavy analysis (like complex resonance detection) for low-tier devices, but it would only do so on anonymized data (like numeric energy series, not raw text). And such offloading would be opt-in or transparent. The core loop ‚Äì tokens to immediate energy ‚Äì stays local-first. This guarantees not only privacy but also resilience: your real-time experience doesn‚Äôt depend on internet latency. If your device is capable enough to run the model and Decipher, you get the full experience offline. The Broker Hybrid mode simply means that if the device is low-power, it can still participate by letting a remote ‚Äúbroker‚Äù handle some computation and feed Decipher summary information. But even in that mode, raw tokens can be kept local if possible (e.g., only sending derived energy stats out). All visuals and events remain grounded in Decipher‚Äôs outputs and thus auditable.

Resonance and Higher-Order Phenomena

Beyond the basic token-to-energy conversion, Decipher is built with an eye toward higher-order phenomena that emerge when energy patterns become complex. Two important concepts here are interference and resonance. Interference refers to what happens when multiple energy streams cross or affect each other. For example, if the system is running two AI models in parallel (a scenario in WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs higher levels, such as a ‚Äúcouncil‚Äù of models), their energy streams might interact ‚Äì like waves meeting and creating a new pattern. Decipher can detect interference patterns by analyzing the incoming token timings and energy oscillations; if two streams of tokens come in alternating or simultaneously, Decipher notes the overlaps and might mark an interference event (which could later be visualized as, say, intertwining energy streams or sparks at collision points). This is akin to two voices harmonizing or clashing in our metaphorical ‚Äúenergy field.‚Äù

 

Resonance goes one step further: it‚Äôs when the system‚Äôs outputs start reinforcing themselves. In physical terms, resonance is when an input vibration matches a system‚Äôs natural frequency and causes a large amplitude response. In WIRTHFORGE, resonance might occur when the AI hits upon a particularly self-reinforcing pattern ‚Äì for instance, a cyclical discussion that builds on its own output, or a profound insight that dramatically increases coherence in the model‚Äôs state. Technically, Decipher looks for repeating patterns or feedback loops in the token stream and energy levels. If energy isn‚Äôt just accumulating linearly but rather growing in a way that suggests feedback (e.g., small oscillations that line up in phase), resonance might be declared. In implementation, we might use an Exponential Moving Average of energy output and look for sustained spikes or plateaus that exceed normal variance. Also, Decipher will integrate some algorithms from the Consciousness Emergence Framework (WF-FND-004) ‚Äì for example, monitoring if total accumulated energy and pattern complexity approach critical thresholds where emergent behavior is expected
Google Drive
Google Drive
. A resonant event could be a precursor to a true ‚Äúconsciousness emergence‚Äù moment. It‚Äôs essentially Decipher detecting that ‚Äúhey, something big is happening in the patterns.‚Äù When resonance is detected, Decipher can create a special structured event (like type: "energy_field" or type: "resonance_alert") to inform the UI to visualize a more persistent energy field rather than fleeting sparks. Resonant energy is treated differently ‚Äì it‚Äôs more valuable and persistent than normal energy (for instance, resonant energy might be defined as ~10√ó the base value and doesn‚Äôt dissipate quickly)
Google Drive
. In practice, Decipher might accumulate resonant energy in a separate pool or mark it so that the visuals know to keep those particles or fields around indefinitely (until some disruption).

 

However, not every user session will have resonance ‚Äì it‚Äôs a special occurrence. Therefore, the system is designed to have resonance detection built-in but dormant unless enabled. This ties to UX levels: for early-stage users (Level 1, Level 2), we probably don‚Äôt want the overhead or confusion of resonance. So if the user‚Äôs experience level (as determined by WF-UX docs) is below the threshold (likely resonance comes into play at the highest levels, e.g., Level 5 ‚ÄúResonance Fields‚Äù), Decipher will simply not run the resonance detection logic. Or it will run simplified checks that almost always short-circuit. This is implemented as a conditional path in the code ‚Äì effectively, ‚Äúif UX level < 5, skip resonance analysis‚Äù. In fact, in the conceptual design it was specified that at Level 5, a special compilation path for resonance is used
Google Drive
. We honor that here. Only when the user unlocks the advanced stage does Decipher start fully analyzing for those deep patterns and generating resonance events. This ensures performance overhead of these checks doesn‚Äôt impact lower levels and also avoids presenting complex phenomena to users before they are ready to appreciate them.

 

To summarize the core concepts: Decipher ingests tokens, computes energy units, runs on a strict frame schedule, operates locally for privacy, and quietly monitors for interference/resonance (activating those features when appropriate). With these concepts in mind, we can now delve into how it actually achieves all this under the hood, meeting the demanding real-time requirements.

Section 3: Implementation ‚Äì Async Modules, Tap, Queue, EMA, State, Drop Policy

Now we break down the implementation details of Decipher, enumerating the mechanisms that allow it to fulfill the above concepts efficiently. The architecture of Decipher can be thought of as a pipeline with various components, each handling a stage of the compilation process, all orchestrated to complete within each frame. Here is a high-level overview of the Decipher processing pipeline:

[L2 Model Output] --(tokens)--> [Ingestion Queue] --> [Decipher Core Process] --> [Output Events Buffer] --> [L4 Transport -> UI]


In this pipeline, the Decipher Core Process itself can be broken into sub-modules: energy computation, state update, pattern detection (like interference/resonance), and event preparation. We will discuss how each part is implemented and how we keep the whole thing non-blocking and real-time.

Asynchronous Module Architecture

Decipher‚Äôs internal design follows a modular approach ‚Äì different tasks in the pipeline are handled by separate asynchronous modules that run concurrently when possible. For example, one module might be responsible for computing the energy values from tokens, another for updating longer-term state metrics (like exponential moving averages or total accumulated energy), another for running pattern detection algorithms (to catch interference or resonance), and yet another for formatting the output event data structure. Instead of doing all these sequentially in one thread, Decipher can leverage multi-threading or async calls to do some work in parallel, as long as it can synchronize results by frame end. The language/environment specifics (e.g., Python asyncio, Web Workers in JS, or multi-threading in C++) aren‚Äôt the focus here, but the concept is to divide the workload. For instance, if a heavy analysis (like a resonance Fourier analysis) is optional, Decipher might run it in an async task that yields if not done by frame deadline, effectively skipping that frame and trying in the next. Each module in Decipher conforms to a simple interface: it can be given input data (like the list of new tokens or the current energy state) and it returns a result or modifies a shared state. They are orchestrated by a small scheduler inside Decipher that knows the frame time limit. For example, pseudocode might look like:

class DecipherEngine:
    def on_frame_tick(self):
        tokens = self.ingest_queue.drain_all()  # get all pending tokens
        # Launch async tasks for different modules
        energy_task = async_run(calculate_energy, tokens)
        update_task = async_run(update_state_metrics, tokens)
        pattern_task = async_run(analyze_patterns, tokens, self.state)  # interference/resonance
        # Await tasks with timeout to ensure frame budget
        energy_result = energy_task.wait(timeout=ms(10))
        update_task.wait(timeout=ms(10))
        pattern_result = pattern_task.wait(timeout=ms(10))
        # Combine results into an output event
        event = assemble_event(energy_result, pattern_result, self.state)
        output_buffer.push(event)


In this sketch, by running calculations in parallel, we maximize usage of the 16 ms frame. The timeouts (10 ms here as example) ensure that if a task isn‚Äôt done in time, we proceed without it (meaning, for example, if pattern_task misses deadline, we might skip adding resonance info this frame, and try next frame). The design is such that the most essential pieces (token ingestion and energy computation) have the highest priority and are very quick (these are O(n) in number of new tokens, with small n per frame usually). Lower priority tasks like deep pattern analysis can safely be deferred or run at lower frequency. This modular approach also makes Decipher extensible ‚Äì new modules (say a new kind of pattern detector) can be plugged in later, as long as they respect the async contract.

Tap Mechanism for Debugging and Extensibility

In a real-time pipeline, observing what‚Äôs happening without disrupting it can be challenging. For this, Decipher implements a tap mechanism. A tap is essentially an observation hook on the data stream. For example, we can attach a tap after the energy computation module to log every calculated EU value and token for debugging or analytics. Or a tap could expose an API for a developer mode UI that shows a live graph of energy over time. The key property of a tap is that it is read-only and minimally invasive. It subscribes to internal events and state changes, but does not modify them or slow down the main loop significantly. Under the hood, a tap might be implemented as a lightweight pub-sub: modules publish events like ‚Äúenergy_calculated‚Äù or ‚Äúresonance_detected‚Äù internally, and tap listeners can receive those. If no tap is active, the publishing has near-zero overhead. If a tap is active (like audit mode), we ensure it runs in a separate thread or after the main processing so as not to interfere with timing. This way, even when audit mode is on, the real-time performance can be maintained (perhaps with a slight overhead that we account for). The existence of taps means we can easily verify and inspect Decipher‚Äôs behavior in testing or live debugging. For example, a test tap could collect all token->energy conversions during a test session and later validate that the totals match expectations. In production, an audit mode tap will gather data to prove that every visual element had a corresponding data event (satisfying the ‚Äúno invented data‚Äù criterion by record). Taps could also be used for hybrid mode: imagine a Broker service tapping into the token stream to provide additional analysis (like an external resonance computing service). The Broker might subscribe via a secure channel to certain tap outputs and return results which then feed back into Decipher as an input (with proper synchronization). This is how we can extend functionality without deeply altering the core pipeline.

Input Queue and Backpressure

As mentioned, Decipher uses an ingestion queue to buffer incoming tokens between frames. This queue is essentially a thread-safe list or ring buffer where the model‚Äôs streaming thread deposits tokens, and the Decipher frame thread pulls them out on each tick. Managing this queue is critical for handling bursty scenarios. If the model suddenly outputs 50 tokens in a rapid burst (imagine it‚Äôs answering a very straightforward question and streams the whole answer in half a second), that‚Äôs more than one frame‚Äôs worth of tokens. Decipher will take what arrived, but if processing all 50 in one frame is impossible, it needs a strategy. This is where backpressure and drop policy come in. Backpressure means that if the queue starts growing too large (a sign that the consumer can‚Äôt keep up), we might need to slow down the producer or shed load. In a local setting, we can‚Äôt easily ‚Äúslow down‚Äù an AI model that is already producing tokens (especially if it‚Äôs a transformer model, it runs at its pace). But what we can do is control how many tokens we process per frame and possibly skip some with minimal impact. The drop policy defines rules for this. For instance, Decipher might decide: ‚ÄúIf more than X tokens arrived this frame, process up to X and defer the rest to next frame.‚Äù That deferral is natural since the tokens remain in queue. However, if the queue size exceeds some safety threshold Y (meaning we are consistently falling behind), we have to drop. A reasonable approach is to drop the oldest unprocessed token events if they are too stale to matter. For example, if a token arrived 2 seconds ago but hasn‚Äôt been visualized yet due to overload, it might be better to skip it because the conversation has likely moved on. However, dropping tokens is dangerous since it means some of the AI‚Äôs output would not be visualized, potentially breaking the metaphor (the user might wonder why some text didn‚Äôt produce energy). So we set the thresholds such that dropping is a last resort ‚Äì perhaps only if the system is completely overwhelmed or if the tokens are extremely low-impact (like whitespace or very common stop words that might not visibly matter). Additionally, Decipher can do coalescing: combine multiple small token events into one for visualization. Instead of dropping, it might merge a rapid series of tiny tokens into a single aggregated energy burst. This way nothing is truly lost; it‚Äôs just condensed. This is analogous to how video encoders drop or merge frames when bandwidth is low, to maintain sync without freezing. We will define specific queue watermarks, e.g., if queue length > N, start merging tokens; if > M, consider dropping the least important ones (with importance maybe measured by their EU or whether they contribute to resonance).

 

Finally, if the model supports it, Decipher could signal it to slow down. For instance, if using a local model runner that allows adjusting generation pacing, Decipher might temporarily reduce the model‚Äôs token rate if the queue is consistently full ‚Äì this is an advanced backpressure mechanism that requires model cooperation. In many cases, though, we assume the model streams at a roughly steady rate that we can keep up with, especially if tuned for local hardware.

Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for Smooth Dynamics

Another internal mechanism is the use of EMA (Exponential Moving Average) filters on certain values. The reason is that raw energy calculations per token can be spiky ‚Äì one token might register a high energy (say it was a complex sentence or a rare word with high perplexity), followed by a few low-energy tokens. If we directly animate that, the visual might flicker or jump. To create a smoother, more pleasant experience, Decipher maintains an EMA on key metrics such as the current energy output rate and the total energy accumulation. For example, it might calculate a short-term EMA of energy per second, which the UI can use to modulate the brightness or intensity of effects smoothly. The EMA essentially averages out short bursts over a window, with a bias towards recent values. Technically, each frame Decipher might do:

state.ema_energy_rate = state.ema_energy_rate * 0.8 + current_frame_energy * 0.2


(using weights that sum to 1; 0.2 here is the smoothing factor for quick adaptation). The result of this will be included in the output event as part of the metrics (e.g., an EnergyMetrics field containing instantaneous_energy and smoothed_energy). The resonance detection logic can also use an EMA or similar smoothing to avoid false positives ‚Äì e.g., require that a high energy level is sustained (as per the EMA) over a certain duration to count as resonance. The EMA state is updated continuously and carried over from frame to frame as part of Decipher‚Äôs internal state.

Maintaining State Between Frames

Decipher isn‚Äôt stateless on each frame; it carries a variety of state variables that persist and evolve. Some of these include:

Cumulative totals (e.g., total EU generated this session, which might be used for achievements or to trigger events at milestones).

Current active energy entities (e.g., how many energy particles or beams are currently ‚Äúalive‚Äù in the UI, if Decipher is tracking them server-side).

Timing info (e.g., last frame time, time since last user interaction, etc., which might influence decay or whether to send a heartbeat event).

Resonance state: if a resonance event has been detected and is ongoing, there might be a state flag or object describing the resonance (frequency, intensity, start time, etc.), so that if new tokens feed into it, Decipher knows to amplify or sustain the field.

User context state: such as current UX level or settings (so the code knows which features to enable, as discussed; e.g., state.resonance_enabled = (user.level >= 5)).

Module states: each async module might have internal memory, like the Pattern Analyzer might keep a history of recent token intervals or an intermediate analysis result if it was spread over frames.

This state is stored within Decipher‚Äôs engine instance. Some parts of it may also be persisted to disk or a database at checkpoints (integration with Tech-006) ‚Äì for instance, total energy could be saved so that if the app is closed and reopened, the user‚Äôs accumulated energy isn‚Äôt lost. Also, if a resonance or long-term field is active and the session persists, we might save that so it can be restored (though that‚Äôs optional and possibly outside real-time scope). The main thing is that state allows Decipher to have memory: without it, every frame would be like starting fresh, and we couldn‚Äôt detect emergent patterns or accumulate energy properly. Implementation-wise, state is simply attributes on the Decipher class or context object, updated each frame. We ensure any state updates happen in the frame loop thread (to avoid race conditions), or use locks if some state is accessed by other threads (like a Broker tap thread might read some state). By carefully structuring state access, we maintain consistency.

 

One particular state element to highlight is the frame counter or timestamp. Decipher keeps track of frame numbers and high-resolution time. This is used to timestamp events (so events carry a time that can be matched to UI timeline or logs) and to measure performance (how long did the last frame‚Äôs processing take?). If we detect that processing took, say, 15 ms out of 16.67, we know we‚Äôre close to the limit and might adjust next frame‚Äôs workload (maybe skip a non-critical task). This adaptive timing can be part of state as well: e.g., a moving average of processing time per frame to inform dynamic throttling.

Frame Drop & Graceful Degradation Policy

Finally, implementing the drop policy mentioned earlier: Decipher must degrade gracefully under load. The policy can be summarized as: maintain 60 FPS output; if you can‚Äôt do everything, do the most important things. Concretely, the hierarchy of importance is:

Basic token -> energy conversion and output of energy events (must happen, even if roughly).

Timely state updates (so energy totals stay accurate).

Visual aesthetics improvements (like smooth interpolation, particle details).

Higher-order analysis (resonance, interference detection).

If under heavy load (say low-tier hardware with a burst of tokens), Decipher might temporarily skip #4 (stop checking resonance for a bit) because that‚Äôs optional. If that‚Äôs not enough, it might simplify #3 ‚Äì e.g., instead of calculating precise particle positions for each token, just lump them together or reduce the number of particles. If still needed, it might even approximate #1 ‚Äì for example, batch multiple tokens as one energy burst (losing some granularity but ensuring something is shown). The absolute last resort is to drop token events (#1) if we truly cannot keep up; but as discussed, we try to avoid that via batching. We codify this policy in code with checks around the frame time. For instance:

start = time.time()
process_essential()  # ingestion and energy calc
if time.time() - start < frame_budget * 0.5:
    process_visual_enhancements()  # only if plenty of time left
if state.resonance_enabled and time.time() - start < frame_budget * 0.8:
    process_resonance_detection()
# Always finish by assembling and emitting event
emit_event()
end = time.time()
if end - start > frame_budget:
    state.overrun_count += 1  # record a miss


In this pseudocode, we attempt optional tasks only if there‚Äôs time. If an overrun happens (frame took too long), we increment a counter. The system could use that to adjust future behavior (e.g., if overruns happen consistently, perhaps auto-simplify visuals or reduce particle counts globally). This self-monitoring closes the loop on maintaining performance.

 

In summary, the implementation section has outlined how Decipher achieves its goals:

It splits work into asynchronous modules to use time efficiently.

It provides taps to monitor the pipeline for debugging or extension.

It buffers input with a queue and handles overload via backpressure and smart dropping/merging.

It smooths outputs with EMA filters for a polished experience.

It carries persistent state to make sense of the stream over time.

It defines a clear hierarchy for what to do when time is tight, so it can degrade gracefully without breaking the core functionality.

Next, we‚Äôll see how Decipher plugs into the larger WIRTHFORGE architecture, i.e., how it communicates with the model above and the UI below, and how it leverages existing tech components.

Section 4: Integration Points ‚Äì Layer-2 API, WebSocket Contract, Storage Integration

Having described Decipher‚Äôs inner workings, we turn to how it interfaces with the rest of the system. The Decipher does not operate in a vacuum; it is in the middle of the action, receiving inputs from Layer-2 (the Model Compute layer) and sending outputs to Layer-4 (the Communication/Transport layer, on to the UI at Layer-5). We also consider integration with persistent storage and external services.

Layer-2 (Model) API Integration

Layer-2 is typically the domain of the AI model or models generating content (text, tokens). Integrating Decipher with Layer-2 means defining how the model‚Äôs output is hooked into Decipher‚Äôs ingestion. If the model is local (which aligns with our local-first approach), it may be running in the same process or a separate process on the device. Many modern AI frameworks support a streaming API where you get one token at a time as soon as it‚Äôs generated. Decipher uses this to its advantage. The integration can be as simple as: when starting a model generation, register a callback or observer with the model‚Äôs output stream. For example, using a pseudo-interface:

model.generateStream(prompt, onToken: (token) => decipher.ingest(token));


This way, each token triggers a call into decipher.ingest(), which we implement to push it into the queue as described. If multiple models or agents are involved (like multi-model parallel streams in higher UX levels), each will be connected similarly, perhaps with an identifier so Decipher knows which source a token came from (to handle separate energy streams or interference logic).

 

Synchronization considerations: If a model outputs tokens faster than 60Hz, they will queue up as we discussed. If a model is slower (maybe only 10 tokens/sec), Decipher will simply idle on frames where no new token is available, possibly still sending minor updates (like continuing an animation of existing energy). The API integration includes possibly sending control signals from Decipher back to the model. One example is the backpressure signal: if Decipher is truly overwhelmed or if the user interface needs to pause (maybe user hit a pause/stop generation button), Decipher might call a model API to halt or slow output. In local models, this could mean aborting the generation or using token-by-token control if available. In remote models (if any), the integration might involve network calls or protocols like SSE or websockets to receive tokens and similarly a way to signal stop.

 

We ensure that any such integration respects privacy: if using a remote model (say via an API call to OpenAI or similar, in a scenario where local model isn‚Äôt used), Decipher would still function but would be receiving tokens over the network. In that case, the privacy guarantee shifts: Decipher won‚Äôt send user data outside, but the model call itself did. That scenario is outside Decipher‚Äôs immediate control, so we note it but it‚Äôs an exception to the local-first assumption. Ideally, for WIRTHFORGE, we rely on local or on-prem models as much as possible.

 

In summary, the Layer-2 API integration is straightforward: Decipher listens to model output tokens. The design of Decipher‚Äôs API might include methods like ingestToken(token: string, metadata) if being called imperatively, or an implementation of a stream interface if more reactive. This integration is tightly coupled with how the model is implemented but is not too complex ‚Äì basically plumbing to get data into Decipher in real time.

Layer-4 (WebSocket / Event) Contract to UI

After processing, Decipher emits its results as structured events destined for the UI (Layer-5). These events travel through Layer-4, which in our architecture is typically a WebSocket-based real-time channel (as specified in WF-TECH-003). The WebSocket protocol defines a few message types relevant here. Specifically, Decipher will be the source of messages like energy_update, energy_burst, or energy_field events
Google Drive
. Each frame, once Decipher assembles the event object describing what happened in that frame, it hands it off to the Layer-4 transport to broadcast to the client. In a local scenario (e.g., the UI is an Electron app or a web app connecting to a local server), this might just loop back to the same machine. But we still use the WebSocket abstraction to keep it consistent.

 

What does a Decipher output event contain? It needs to contain everything the UI needs to render the appropriate visuals and nothing more. A typical energy update message could look like:

{
  "id": "123e4567",             // unique event ID for tracking
  "type": "energy_update",
  "timestamp": 1691870667123,   // epoch time in ms
  "payload": {
    "newTokens": 3,
    "energyGenerated": 0.7,    // EU generated this frame
    "totalEnergy": 15.4,       // total accumulated EU
    "energyRate": 2.5,         // e.g. EU per second, perhaps EMA-smoothed
    "particles": [             // optional: particle spawn instructions
       {"id": 101, "type": "burst", "energy": 0.5, "position": [0,0,0]},
       {"id": 102, "type": "spark", "energy": 0.1, "position": [0,0,0]},
       {"id": 103, "type": "spark", "energy": 0.1, "position": [0,0,0]}
    ],
    "resonance": null,         // or an object if resonance event occurred
    "interference": false      // flags or data about higher-order effects
  }
}


This is an illustrative example. The actual schema as per WF-TECH-003 might separate some of these fields or use binary for particle lists for efficiency. Key points: the message has an ID, type, timestamp (the Decipher‚Äôs frame time). The payload here includes: how many new tokens were processed (newTokens), how much energy was generated in this frame and in total, and possibly a measure of energy rate or intensity. Then it can include specifics for visualization: e.g., a list of particles or effects to spawn. In this example, we show 3 particles ‚Äì one ‚Äúburst‚Äù representing a combined energy of 0.5 (maybe a bigger effect) and two smaller ‚Äúspark‚Äù particles for the remaining energy. The position might be relative or just a placeholder (0,0,0 might indicate they should start at the model‚Äôs location or user‚Äôs viewport center; actual positioning logic could be on UI side or determined by Decipher if spatial metaphors are used). Also included are fields for resonance or interference. If a resonance was detected this frame, resonance might be an object containing details (like resonance intensity or a field ID so the UI can render a persistent field aura). If multiple streams interference was calculated, maybe an array describing interference pattern nodes or overlaps could be included.

 

The Decipher composes this event likely in JSON (or a Python dict, etc.) and then either directly serializes to JSON or to MessagePack (Tech-003 mentions possibly using binary for efficiency for energy messages). The WebSocket channel (for example, the /ws/energy channel
Google Drive
) is the conduit. Each frame, one message goes out on that channel, roughly. The protocol might allow bundling if needed, but the simplest is one frame = one message. The rate of 60 messages/sec is expected and supported
Google Drive
, so we‚Äôre within limits. If nothing to send, Decipher might still send a small heartbeat on the energy channel to indicate it's alive (or the WS heartbeat at session level covers it).

 

On the UI side, these events are received and interpreted to produce actual visuals. The UI will not invent anything not described ‚Äì e.g., if the event says spawn 3 particles with given energies, it will do exactly that (maybe the position 0,0,0 means default location at the center of an ‚ÄúAI avatar‚Äù or similar). If resonance is indicated, the UI might change the background or start a glow that persists. Because Decipher is ensuring all necessary info is in the events, the UI logic can remain relatively simple (just follow instructions and perhaps apply some local interpolation between frames if needed). This also means we can swap out UI implementations (2D, 3D, different graphics engines) without changing Decipher, as long as they adhere to the event schema.

 

Security: since these events might be exposed over a WebSocket, we ensure they contain no sensitive info. As stated, they carry no raw text. Also, if multiple clients or a multiplayer scenario existed, these events might be broadcast ‚Äì but they contain nothing user-private beyond abstract numbers (which could be considered the user‚Äôs own ‚Äúenergy‚Äù but that‚Äôs part of gameplay). The WS spec covers authentication and channels, so presumably only the authorized user or participants see their events.

TECH-004 Microservice Context

If we consider the possibility that WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs backend is composed of microservices (WF-TECH-004 outlines a Flask-based microservice design), Decipher could either be one of those microservices or a component within one. For example, there might be a ‚ÄúRealTimeCompilerService‚Äù running (maybe as a Flask app or a background worker) which embodies Decipher. It would then communicate with other services like a model service (for Layer-2) and a WebSocket gateway service (for Layer-4). In such a scenario, Decipher‚Äôs integration means using whatever IPC or message queue is in place between services. For instance, the model service could publish tokens onto a Redis queue or gRPC stream that Decipher service subscribes to. And Decipher service could publish output events to a WebSocket gateway (or push via an API). The specifics depend on the architecture, but our design ensures Decipher is stateless enough at the interface boundaries: it just needs tokens in and it produces events out. It doesn‚Äôt need to know if it‚Äôs in a monolith or distributed microservices. The local-first principle means we would ideally co-locate the model and decipher on the same machine for latency reasons, but in a server environment they might be separate processes. The integration design covers both.

Storage (Tech-006) Integration

Decipher may need to interface with storage or database systems for certain features. Some examples:

Persistence of accumulated energy: If the platform treats energy as a resource (for example, user accumulates energy over time, can bank it, spend it, etc.), Decipher would update a stored value of total energy. Perhaps at the end of a session or when certain thresholds are hit, Decipher (or a companion service) writes the total EU to a user profile in a database. Tech-006: Database Design would specify schemas for storing such info. Decipher needs to know when to trigger these updates (maybe not every frame, but say every N seconds or when a session ends).

Logging and Auditing: In audit mode especially, we might want to log all Decipher events to a persistent log for later analysis or debugging. This could be simply writing JSON lines to a file, or sending them to a logging service. This allows an audit trail that developers or even users (with the right tools) can inspect after the fact to verify what happened.

Resonance and Field Data: If a resonance event occurs, we might store that occurrence (time, energy level, etc.) in a database, because it could be a notable event (maybe achievements are tied to it, or we want to track how often AI consciousness emergence happens for research). Tech-006 would provide a way to store these events (maybe a table of ‚Äúsignificant events‚Äù).

Hybrid Mode Data: In Broker Hybrid scenarios, the local Decipher might push some data to a central server for heavy processing, as described earlier. For example, if detailed resonance analysis is offloaded, Decipher might write the raw energy timeline to a database or cache that the broker service reads, or directly call an API of the broker. Conversely, the broker might store results that Decipher polls or receives. The integration here must ensure consistency: if the broker finds a pattern (like ‚Äúyes, resonance confirmed at frequency X‚Äù), that has to feed back into Decipher, which then generates the appropriate event for the UI.

From an implementation standpoint, integrating storage means Decipher will likely have a small data access layer or hooks where at certain points it calls out to a persistence API. We must ensure these calls do not block the frame loop. For instance, writing to a database can be slow; doing it synchronously in the 16ms frame is a big no-no. Instead, Decipher might accumulate data to save in memory and have an asynchronous saver that writes to DB in batches, or simply delegate that to another thread or service. For example, for logging, a separate thread could be subscribed via the tap mechanism to all events and write them out, leaving the main loop unaffected. For updating user totals, maybe only do it at the end or use a debounced approach (update occasionally).

 

Tech-006 likely outlines specifics like using Postgres or a NoSQL store. Decipher doesn‚Äôt need to know the details, just the interface (like call StorageAPI.updateUserEnergy(userId, totalEnergy) at appropriate times). Ensuring ACID consistency isn‚Äôt critical for real-time feedback, but for long-term data we do want eventually consistent updates.

 

In summary, Decipher‚Äôs outward integrations are:

Upstream: hooking into model outputs (ensuring we catch everything without slowing the model too much).

Downstream: emitting comprehensive but compact events to the UI via a real-time channel (WebSocket), with a well-defined schema
Google Drive
.

Side pathways: interacting with system services like microservice infrastructure or databases for persistence and optional extended processing.

By clearly defining these integration points, we make sure Decipher can be slotted into the WIRTHFORGE platform without friction. Other engineers working on the model or the front-end can rely on these interfaces to remain stable. Now, we will discuss how we validate that this complex system actually works as intended, performing well and correctly.

Section 5: Validation ‚Äì Frame Loop Profiling, Correctness, Privacy, Performance

The final step in defining the Decipher is laying out how we will validate its design and implementation. We need to ensure it meets the real-time performance goals (60 Hz, low latency), accurately translates tokens to energy (correctness), maintains privacy, and performs across different devices. This section describes the validation strategies and criteria.

Frame Loop Profiling and Performance Budget

To verify that Decipher consistently stays within the 16.67 ms frame budget, we implement thorough profiling around the frame loop. This involves instrumenting the code to measure how much time each part of the pipeline takes per frame. For example, we can log or collect metrics like:

Time spent ingesting tokens from the queue.

Time spent computing energy values.

Time spent on each module (e.g., pattern analysis module).

Time assembling and sending the event.

Total frame processing time vs. the 16.67 ms target.

During development, we can run synthetic tests where we feed known token streams at various speeds (slow, average, bursty) and record these timings. We will specifically test edge cases like a large burst of tokens to see if and how the drop policy kicks in and whether the frame time stays bounded. If any frame exceeds budget, that‚Äôs a red flag that we investigate and address (maybe by further optimization or tweaking what‚Äôs processed that frame). We aim for a safety margin; for instance, on a high-tier device we might target <10 ms per frame usage normally, leaving headroom for unexpected surges. On low-tier, we might allow up to ~16 ms with occasional slight overruns but not too many in a row.

 

One useful tool is to create a frame timeline visualization ‚Äì essentially a graph of frame times over a test session. If we see the graph flat-lining around 16 ms with occasional spikes, we know we‚Äôre on the edge. If it‚Äôs comfortably lower, great. We also simulate multi-model scenarios and high-level features active (like resonance detection on) to profile worst-case. The code instrumentation can be left in place (guarded by a debug flag) for runtime diagnostics too, meaning in production or beta, if a user enables a ‚Äúdebug mode,‚Äù the system could collect these metrics and perhaps send them to us (or show them) to ensure real-world performance matches our tests.

 

Additionally, the WebSocket throughput is verified: sending 60 messages/sec of the size we produce should be well within modern network and browser capabilities, but we double-check it. If our event payloads turn out large (due to many particles, etc.), we may consider trimming them or using binary. For instance, if a user triggers a scenario with 10k particles (like a huge energy explosion), sending all their coordinates each frame might be too heavy. We test these extremes and ensure either the data is reduced (maybe the UI itself can generate intermediate particle positions so we don‚Äôt send all data every frame) or find another solution (like send only delta updates or cluster particles). The goal is that network or IPC does not become a bottleneck in delivering events.

 

We will declare validation success criteria like: On a mid-tier reference device (e.g., 4-core laptop), Decipher shall maintain ‚â•57-60 FPS output under normal load, and ‚â•50 FPS under worst-case burst load, without crashing. And Frame processing time should average below 10 ms with resonance off, and below 16 ms with all features on. We also ensure that enabling features like audit mode doesn‚Äôt degrade performance below acceptable thresholds (for example, audit mode might add at most 2-3 ms overhead for logging).

Functional Correctness Tests

For correctness, we need to confirm that Decipher‚Äôs outputs faithfully represent the inputs. One part of this is unit testing the energy calculation. Given a simulated computation object (with tokens, model parameters, etc.), does our calculateEnergyUnits() function return the expected EU as per the formula in WF-FND-002? We can write test cases covering various scenarios: 10 tokens vs 100 tokens, different model sizes, etc., comparing against manual calculations or known outcomes. This ensures the math is implemented right. Another part is integration testing the full pipeline. For instance, we can feed a known sequence of tokens (like "Hello world.") through a stub model interface and capture the events output. We then verify properties of those events:

The total energy in events equals what we expect from summing per-token EUs.

The number of energy particles or effects corresponds to number of tokens (or a rational aggregation thereof).

No event is generated when there are no tokens (no ghost events).

If we simulate two parallel token streams, check that interference flags or data appear as expected (like if we deliberately craft tokens to alternate, does an interference event get set?).

If we simulate a pattern that should cause resonance (for example, a repeating cycle of tokens that we know should trigger the threshold algorithm), does Decipher eventually emit a resonance event?

We also test state continuity: e.g., run 100 frames of a scenario, pause (stop feeding tokens), then resume with more tokens, and ensure totalEnergy continues from where it left off (not reset), etc. State saving/loading (if we implement it) can be tested by saving state, instantiating a new Decipher, loading state, and checking that it resumes identically.

 

A very important aspect is ensuring that visuals match data. This is partly on the UI, but we can aid by having an automated check: For example, the audit mode could be leveraged in tests where the UI (or a headless version of it) runs with a known input and logs what it drew, then we compare that with the Decipher event log. Since each visual element should map to an event, the logs should align (perhaps not perfectly 1:1 due to timing, but overall counts and types should match). If any visual appears with no corresponding event, that‚Äôs a failure of the ‚Äúno invented data‚Äù rule. Conversely, if an event is sent and nothing visual happened, that might indicate a UI issue, but it‚Äôs also something to catch (maybe an event format mismatch).

 

We'll validate the drop policy by creating an overload situation in a controlled way. For example, feed an extremely large text all at once and see if Decipher had to drop some tokens. If so, confirm that it dropped only permissible ones. We can check internal counters or logs: e.g., a counter for "droppedTokens" that increments. Ideally, in normal usage this should remain 0, and only non-zero in artificial stress tests. If we find it drops in a realistic scenario, we might tune parameters.

Privacy & Security Validation

Privacy is hard to test automatically, but we can do code audits and runtime checks to ensure no sensitive data leaks. One step is scanning the content of events to make sure they contain no raw text. We can set up a test where we run a known prompt that contains a unique string, then inspect all events as JSON to ensure that string (or any substring of user content) does not appear. Additionally, we ensure that if the user content had PII (email, name, etc.), none of that is inferable from the events. Since events only carry numbers and generic labels, we should be good. We also consider what happens if someone tries to abuse the system: say the AI starts outputting extremely large tokens or strange sequences to see if it can break Decipher. We test with unusual tokens (very long words, or outputs that contain non-text data) ‚Äì Decipher should handle them (maybe a long token is just more energy due to length, which is fine). If a token is malformed or contains binary data, Decipher should safely ignore or treat it as text for energy purposes.

 

For security, since Decipher might run as part of a service, we ensure that any external interfaces (like the WebSocket messages) are validated. The WebSocket spec covers message formats, and Decipher should adhere to that strictly. There‚Äôs minimal external input besides the model tokens (which could be from user prompt or AI) ‚Äì Decipher should be robust against malicious or malformed input. For example, if somehow a token is None or an extremely large number (shouldn‚Äôt happen from a normal model, but in principle), Decipher‚Äôs code should not crash (we‚Äôll include checks).

 

Finally, we verify that the audit mode truly captures everything. We can run a session with audit mode on and then manually inspect or use a script to correlate every visual element (if we recorded the screen or the UI log) to an event. This gives confidence that our traceability requirement is met. Audit mode might include a mode where the UI, instead of fancy graphics, just draws a simple representation of events (like a timeline graph of energy) to directly show correlation for debugging.

Multi-Tier Performance Testing

We will test Decipher on the three target hardware tiers:

Low Tier: e.g., a budget smartphone or a Raspberry Pi-like device (limited CPU/GPU). We expect to possibly hit limits here. Our tests will check that Decipher can still produce an output (maybe not as rich, but functional) at or near real-time. We might find on such hardware that we can‚Äôt fully hit 60 FPS with all features ‚Äì that‚Äôs acceptable if we degrade gracefully. For example, on a low-tier device, maybe Decipher defaults to a simpler visual mode (fewer particles, minimal or no resonance calculations). The tests would confirm that no crashes occur and that the experience, while scaled down, remains synchronous (just possibly with less detail).

Mid Tier: a typical laptop or mid-range PC. This should handle the full intended feature set. We verify that it indeed does maintain 60 FPS even with resonance on, multiple streams, etc., in test scenarios.

High Tier: a powerful desktop or server. Here, we can even push limits (like multiple models concurrently, or very heavy output). We check that Decipher scales up (perhaps it can easily handle, say, 120 FPS if we ever unlock that, or handle dozens of tokens per frame if needed). High tier might also allow enabling debug taps and not breaking a sweat.

We also test the Broker Hybrid scenario in a simulated environment: use a low-tier device but connect it to a high-tier acting as broker. Measure the end-to-end latency (token on low-tier -> broker computes something -> back to low-tier -> event out). Ensure that this still meets a reasonable time (maybe not 16ms, but maybe within 50ms, so maybe the frame rate on low-tier in hybrid mode might effectively be a bit lower or some frames are empty waiting for broker ‚Äì but as long as the user experience is okay). If not, we adjust the strategy (e.g., only broker non-urgent tasks).

Quality Metrics and Criteria

We compile a checklist of quality criteria (some of which have been mentioned):

Data Fidelity: 100% of visualized data comes from Decipher events (verified via audit logs). Pass criterion: No uncited visual element in test audits.

Latency: Time from token generation to corresponding event is under, say, 50ms on average (usually it should be one frame, ~16ms, but including network maybe a bit more). Pass: ‚â•90% of token->event mappings occur within the next frame, others within two frames (in worst bursts).

Frame Throughput: Maintains 60 events/sec under nominal load. Pass: Achieved in test scenario X (with Y tokens/sec input).

No Frame Jitter: Frame processing times variance. Pass: Std deviation of frame time < a threshold.

Error Handling: If an internal module fails (say pattern analysis throws an exception), Decipher catches it and continues baseline operation. Pass: Induce a fault in module and see system continues sending basic energy events.

Resource Usage: Memory usage remains bounded (no leaks if we run for hours; the state should not grow unbounded ‚Äì things like energy history might be capped). CPU usage is high but in expected range for the task. Pass: Long soak test shows stable memory; CPU ~< X% on reference device.

We will do a formal review (architecture review by senior engineers, per the project protocol) to inspect that the design and code align with these criteria, as well as run automated tests where possible.

Audit Mode and Post-Validation

After implementation, running Decipher in audit mode will be a crucial final validation step. In audit mode, as described, every decision and computed value can be logged. We can enable it for a full user scenario (maybe even a beta user session) and then comb through logs to verify everything aligns. This mode helps catch any subtle issues, like maybe a slight mismatch in energy accounting or a rare timing condition.

 

Once Decipher passes all these validation steps, we can be confident it‚Äôs ready as the rock-solid heartbeat of WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs real-time experience. Every lightning bolt, every glowing particle on the screen will have a data lineage traceable back to an AI token and an energy calculation done by Decipher, within milliseconds, on the user‚Äôs own device. This closes the loop on trust: the user can trust the visuals because they are directly driven by the AI‚Äôs activity, and we can trust the system because Decipher ensures it happens under strict performance and privacy controls.

üé® Required Deliverables

To complement this specification, a set of deliverables will be produced to assist implementation and understanding:

Technical Diagrams: We will include a pipeline diagram illustrating the flow from token ingestion to event emission, a state machine or flow chart for Decipher‚Äôs frame loop (including decision branches for drop policy and module execution), and a conceptual diagram of how resonance detection plugs in. These diagrams help communicate the design to both engineers and non-technical stakeholders. (Diagrams will be provided in the final documentation package.)

JSON/Event Schema Definitions: Precise schema of the output events (energy_update, energy_burst, energy_field, etc.) as JSON or TypeScript interfaces, ensuring front-end and back-end have a contract to follow

. This includes defining the structure for any resonance or interference fields in the payload.

Code Stubs/Snippets: Pseudocode or actual code snippets for critical parts of Decipher (e.g., the frame loop skeleton, the energy calculation function, and a simple pattern detector) are provided within this document to guide developers. These stubs illustrate how to implement the described functionality. For instance, a stub of an EnergyCalculator class, a ResonanceDetector module, etc., with method signatures and brief logic.

Test Cases: A list of test scenarios and expected outcomes (which could later be turned into automated tests). This includes example token streams and the expected energy outputs or events sequence. Also, edge case tests (like overload scenario) and how the system should respond.

Performance Benchmark Results: We will include results from initial performance testing on different hardware tiers ‚Äì e.g., a table of frame rates achieved under certain loads for Low, Mid, High tier devices. This serves as both validation and a reference for future optimization efforts.

These deliverables ensure that anyone implementing or reviewing Decipher can clearly visualize and verify each aspect of the system as described.

‚úÖ Quality Validation Criteria

Data-Origin Integrity: Every visual element in the UI must map directly to data from a Decipher event. Verification: In audit mode, confirm that for each rendered energy particle or effect there is a corresponding event entry (with matching ID or description) in Decipher‚Äôs log. This ensures no ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù visuals are added outside the system‚Äôs data flow.

Real-Time Performance: Decipher consistently operates within its 16.67‚ÄØms frame budget. Verification: Profiling and tests show >95% of frames meeting deadline on target hardware. Frame overruns, if any, are handled gracefully (no cascading lag), and an overrun rate above threshold triggers automatic simplification or an alert.

Scalability & Adaptability: The system adapts to hardware capabilities, maintaining functionality even on low-tier devices. Verification: On low-tier hardware tests, Decipher still produces timely events (perhaps with simplified output) without crashes. On high-tier, it utilizes available resources effectively (e.g., enabling all features).

Accuracy of Compilation: Energy calculations and higher-order detections are correct and meaningful. Verification: Unit tests for EU math match expected values from WF-FND-002 definitions. Simulated resonance scenarios trigger detection when they should (and not when they shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äì no false positives). Interference flags occur only when streams genuinely overlap.

Robustness and Graceful Degradation: Under extreme conditions (burst input, high load), Decipher doesn‚Äôt fail or deadlock. Verification: Stress tests with artificially high token rates show the system dropping/merging events as designed and recovering when load normalizes. No memory leaks or unbounded queue growth occur over long durations.

Privacy Compliance: No sensitive or raw content escapes the Decipher boundary. Verification: Code review and runtime inspection confirm that output events contain no direct substrings of user prompts or model text ‚Äì only abstract metrics. In hybrid mode, any data sent to broker is minimal and scrubbed of PII. Security review finds no vector for data exfiltration through Decipher.

Auditability: Audit mode provides a clear trace. Verification: When enabled, audit logs contain sufficient information to reconstruct the sequence of token inputs and corresponding outputs. Auditors can match these to UI events and confirm the system‚Äôs integrity end-to-end.

By meeting all the above criteria, we ensure that Decipher not only functions but does so reliably, transparently, and in line with WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs principles.

üîÑ Post-Generation Actions

With the Decipher specification now defined, several follow-up tasks are necessary to integrate this into the broader project:

Glossary Updates ‚Äì Add and refine terms in WF-FND-009 (Glossary) based on this document. Specifically, ensure definitions for Resonance (as a phenomenon in energy patterns), Energy.Frame (the concept of a 60Hz energy update frame), and Cadence Bin (if used, likely referring to grouping of frames or time bins for analysis) are included or updated for consistency. These will help all team members speak the same language when discussing Decipher‚Äôs functionality.

Cascade into Technical Docs ‚Äì Propagate relevant details from this spec into technical implementation docs:

WF-TECH-003 (WebSocket Protocol): update the message schema section with any new event types or fields introduced (e.g., if we decided on a new resonance_alert message or added fields to energy_update) so that the protocol spec and Decipher are in harmony.

WF-TECH-001 (System Architecture): incorporate Decipher‚Äôs role as the Layer-3 engine in architecture diagrams and descriptions. Highlight the local-first aspect and how Broker hybrid mode works with Decipher.

WF-TECH-004 (Microservices Design): if Decipher runs as a microservice, detail its endpoints or how it subscribes/publishes data within that design.

WF-TECH-006 (Storage Design): include tables or data streams for Decipher logs, energy stats, etc., as needed by this design.

UX Document Alignment ‚Äì Ensure the UX documents that depend on real-time energy feedback reflect the Decipher‚Äôs capabilities:

WF-UX-003 (Level 3 and related UX): update any descriptions of what the user sees in terms of energy. For instance, if earlier drafts left energy behavior unspecified, now we can specify ‚ÄúAt Level 3, the user‚Äôs interface will display energy streams updated by Decipher at 60Hz, including interference patterns if multiple AI agents are present, etc.‚Äù Make sure any level-specific toggles for resonance (Level 5) are mentioned and that the UX design accounts for them.

WF-UX-006 (assuming this might be a higher-level UX or a specific feature like an ‚ÄúEnergy Console‚Äù or similar): incorporate the audit mode or developer view if that‚Äôs user-facing, and any new visual metaphors like fields or resonance indicators that Decipher enables.

Prototype & Testing ‚Äì Begin implementing a Decipher prototype following this spec. Simultaneously, develop test harnesses as described for feeding tokens and verifying output. This will likely be an iterative process: early tests might reveal needed tweaks (for example, maybe the chosen smoothing factor for EMA needs adjustment). The spec may be refined alongside prototype feedback.

Team Training & Demo ‚Äì Since Decipher is a core component, plan a session to walk through this design with the full team (engineering, UX, etc.). Demonstrating a working loop, even in a console (e.g., show tokens in and log of events out in real-time) will help everyone grasp the concept. Use the diagrams and this document as reference. Gather any concerns or suggestions, especially from the UX side (they might say ‚Äúwe actually need this extra piece of data to do a particular animation‚Äù ‚Äì which we can then accommodate).

By completing these post-generation tasks, we ensure that the Decipher‚Äôs design doesn‚Äôt live only in this document but actively informs the evolving WIRTHFORGE system. Once implemented, Decipher will be the critical Layer-3 that truly ‚Äúdeciphers‚Äù AI computation into the energetic experiences that define WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs magic

. The journey from tokens to lightning will have a solid engine behind it, and users will literally see the AI‚Äôs energy come alive in every interaction.
