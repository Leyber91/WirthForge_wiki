# CHANGELOG - WF-FND-005: Experience Orchestration

**Document ID**: WF-FND-005  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Production Ready

## Overview

Experience Orchestration establishes the runtime coordination system for the WIRTHFORGE platform, aligning multi-model execution, progression levels, performance budgets, and governance-aware guardrails. It delivers a 60Hz orchestration engine that adheres to the energy-first visualization mandate and local-first architecture.

## 🎯 Asset Generation Summary

- **Documentation**: 1 foundational specification
- **Data Schemas**: 2 JSON definitions (capabilities, progression)
- **Diagrams**: 4 Mermaid diagrams (orchestration, progression, council, resonance)
- **Code**: 1 Python implementation (orchestration engine)
- **Validation**: 1 comprehensive test suite

## 📋 Detailed Asset Inventory

### 1. Foundation Document
**File**: `docs/WF-FND-005/document.md`
- Complete orchestration architecture and system design
- Executive summary, levels, tiers, and performance constraints

### 2. Data Specifications
- `data/WF-FND-005-experience-capabilities.json`: Levels, tiers, paths, achievements
- `data/WF-FND-005-progression-policies.json`: Rules, unlock criteria, transitions

### 3. Visual Architecture Diagrams
- `assets/diagrams/WF-FND-005-orchestration-engine.mmd`: Core orchestration flow
- `assets/diagrams/WF-FND-005-progression-flow.mmd`: User progression lifecycle
- `assets/diagrams/WF-FND-005-council-coordination.mmd`: Multi-model coordination
- `assets/diagrams/WF-FND-005-resonance-detection.mmd`: Resonance detection

### 4. Code Implementation
**File**: `code/WF-FND-005/orchestration-engine.py`
- Classes: `ExperienceOrchestrator`, `ProgressionManager`, `CouncilEngine`, `ResonanceDetector`, `OrchestrationEventBus`
- 60Hz orchestration with <16.67ms budget, feature gating, event emission

### 5. Validation Suite
**File**: `tests/WF-FND-005/test_orchestration_validation.py`
- 60Hz compliance, event traceability, level gating, hardware tiers, resilience, journey simulation, stress cases

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles
- 60 FPS target; strict 16.67ms orchestration cycle
- Local-first processing; no Docker; privacy-preserving events
- Progressive disclosure via levels and paths; hardware tier adaptation
- Energy metaphors and real-time council coordination

---

## 🔧 Technical Features

### Experience Levels
1. Lightning Strike (L1)
2. Council Formation (L2)
3. Architect Mind (L3)
4. Adaptive Flow (L4)
5. Resonance Fields (L5)

### Hardware Tiers
- Low, Mid, High, Hybrid with appropriate FPS and feature sets

### User Paths
- Forge, Scholar, Sage with differentiated visuals and behaviors

---

## 📊 Performance & QA
- Frame budget: <16.67ms per cycle
- Backpressure and graceful degradation under load
- 95%+ unit coverage on core components; complete integration journeys
- 60Hz compliance across tiers; full traceability and error recovery

---

## 🔗 Integration
- Depends on WF-FND-002 (Energy), WF-FND-003 (Layers), consumes WF-FND-004 (Decipher)
- Enables WF-TECH-006 (APIs), WF-UX-001–005 (UX levels), WF-UX-006 (unified visuals)
- Real-time transport via WebSocket; storage and audit integration

---

## 🚀 Implementation Status
- Phase 1: Core engine ✅
- Phase 2: Multi-model coordination ✅
- Phase 3: Advanced features (resonance, adaptive fields) ✅
- Phase 4: Production deployment 🎯

---

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Integration with WF-FND-004 outputs
- UX alignment with WF-UX-006
- Performance tuning across hardware targets
- Team training and rollout planning
