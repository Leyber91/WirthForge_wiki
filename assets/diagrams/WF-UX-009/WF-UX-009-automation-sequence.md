## Key Automation Principles

### **60Hz Performance Compliance**
- All automation respects 16.67ms frame budget
- Heavy operations are time-sliced across frames
- UI updates maintain smooth 60Hz refresh rate
- Background workers handle intensive processing

### **Resource Management**
- Script sandbox enforces memory and CPU limits
- Plugin execution is monitored and bounded
- Energy consumption is tracked in real-time
- System resources are protected from runaway processes

### **Error Handling and Recovery**
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- User notification for automation errors
- Automatic retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Clean recovery without system corruption

### **Event-Driven Architecture**
- All automation uses consistent event patterns
- Real-time protocol ensures reliable communication
- Energy events provide continuous feedback
- Plugin integration follows standard event flows

### **Security and Isolation**
- Sandboxed execution for all user code
- Permission-based access control for plugins
- Resource limits prevent system impact
- Local-only operation maintains privacy

This automation architecture ensures that advanced workflows can execute complex operations while maintaining WIRTHFORGE's core principles of energy-truth visualization, local-first operation, and 60Hz responsiveness.
