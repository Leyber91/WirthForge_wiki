## Energy-Aware Lifecycle Management

### 1. Backup Timing Optimization
- **Low Load Windows**: Schedule during CPU < 60%, FPS â‰¥ 58
- **Energy Monitoring**: Coordinate with WF-OPS-002 for optimal timing
- **User Activity**: Defer during active user sessions

### 2. Progressive Processing
- **Chunked Operations**: Process files in small chunks to maintain frame budget
- **Pause/Resume**: Automatic pause when system load increases
- **Background Processing**: Low-priority background operations

### 3. Storage Optimization
- **Compression Scheduling**: Compress older backups during idle periods
- **Deduplication**: Content-addressed storage reduces redundancy
- **Cleanup Timing**: Run cleanup only during healthy system windows

### 4. Export Lifecycle
- **On-Demand Export**: Generate encrypted exports only when requested
- **Temporary Storage**: Clean up export files after user download
- **Consent Tracking**: Maintain audit trail of export permissions
