## Document Metadata
- **Document ID**: WF-FND-002
- **Title**: Output Physics & Progressive Levels
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: 2025-01-12
- **Status**: Active
- **Dependencies**: WF-FND-001, WF-META-001
- **Asset Count**: 12 visual assets + supporting materials

## Executive Summary

WF-FND-002 expands on the foundational vision established in WF-FND-001 by detailing the "physics" underlying AI model outputs and the progressive complexity of WIRTHFORGE's five-level visualization system. This document bridges the gap between Ollama's capabilities (including Turbo mode) and WIRTHFORGE's broker architecture, ensuring that every visual element corresponds to measurable computational phenomena.

### Core Innovations

1. **Output Physics Framework**: Maps real AI metrics (token timing, probability distributions, throughput) to visual metaphors (lightning bolts, energy streams, particle effects)

2. **Progressive Level System**: Detailed expansion of the five levels (Lightning → Streams → Structure → Fields → Resonance) with unlocked possibilities at each stage

3. **Broker Architecture**: Replicates Ollama Turbo capabilities through distributed "satellite" models while maintaining local-first principles

4. **Scientific Honesty**: Every visual effect is grounded in measurable data, never fabricated for aesthetic purposes

### Key Metrics and Visual Mappings

- **Token Emission Speed** → Lightning bolt thickness/intensity
- **Time to First Token (TTFT)** → Initial spark/buildup effect  
- **Tokens per Second** → Energy stream brightness/width
- **Probability Distributions** → Particle cloud density/scatter
- **Parallel Stream Interference** → Wave pattern overlays
- **Resonance Events** → Aurora-like celebration effects
