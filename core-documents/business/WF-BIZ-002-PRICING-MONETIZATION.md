📝 Content Architecture
Section 1: Opening Hook

Pricing isn’t just numbers—it’s a contract of trust. Users running WIRTHFORGE locally expect to pay only for the compute they consume and to understand exactly what they’re buying. This section outlines how WIRTHFORGE converts energy usage into fair prices, aligns tiers with progressive levels, and offers add‑ons and marketplace opportunities—all while keeping user data private and billing transparent.

Section 2: Core Concepts

Energy Unit (EU) – The normalized measure of computational work defined in WF‑FND‑002; pricing is denominated in EUs and converts to currency at a published rate.

Tiered Pricing Structure – Four levels: Free/Novice, Adept, Master, and Enterprise. Each tier grants increasing energy budgets, concurrency limits, and feature access
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

Energy‑Based Billing – Users pay per EU consumed beyond their tier allocation. The rate is linear and publicly documented (e.g., €0.0001 per EU), adjusted periodically for hardware efficiency.

Premium Features – Additional capabilities such as multiple parallel models, high‑resolution outputs, or advanced orchestrator controls require either higher tiers or per‑use fees.

Marketplace Revenue – A commission (e.g. 15%) on plugin sales, model licenses, and creative assets; the rest goes to creators.

In‑App Purchases (IAP) – One‑time or small‑recurring purchases for specialized energy patterns (e.g. extra inference boosts) or cosmetic features (e.g. UI themes).

Professional & Enterprise Pricing – Annual or monthly contracts providing larger energy quotas, custom support, and on‑premise deployment.

Retention & Value Delivery – Incentives like loyalty points, referral credits, and community badges encourage long‑term engagement

.

Section 3: Implementation Details
3.1 Pricing Framework & Tier Design

Define a pricing table (Table 1) outlining features, energy allocations, and monthly cost per tier.

Tier	Monthly Price*	Included EUs	Max Parallel Models	Key Features
Free/Novice	€0.00	1 000 EUs	1	Basic models, marketplace browsing
Adept	€9.42	10 000 EUs	2	Premium patterns, parallel models
Master	€29.99	50 000 EUs	4	Advanced orchestrator, priority updates
Enterprise	Custom	Custom	Custom	Dedicated support, on‑prem licenses

*Prices are illustrative; actual rates may vary by region.

Energy beyond quota is billed per EU. For example, a Novice user exceeding 1 000 EUs at €0.0001/EU would incur €0.10 additional cost.

Define conversion funnels: free users have upgrade prompts when they exhaust their energy; they see their consumption in real time, encouraging mindful upgrades.

3.2 Energy Pricing Engine

Create a local billing engine that reads energy metrics from WF‑OPS‑002’s monitoring system. Pseudocode:

# pricing_engine.py - Computes monthly charges based on EU usage
def calculate_bill(user, month):
    tier = user.tier
    quota = TIER_QUOTAS[tier]
    rate_per_eu = get_rate()
    used_eu = get_energy_usage(user, month)  # from local monitor
    excess_eu = max(0, used_eu - quota)
    base_price = TIER_PRICES[tier]
    usage_price = excess_eu * rate_per_eu
    iap_total = sum(p.price for p in user.purchases if p.month == month)
    marketplace_commission = sum(sale.amount * COMMISSION_RATE for sale in user.sales)
    return base_price + usage_price + iap_total - marketplace_commission


The engine runs locally, writing billing data to a local SQLite DB. It never transmits usage data externally unless the user opts into telemetry. A separate module handles encryption and optional export.

Define JSON schemas for pricing tiers, billing models, and payment structures so the UI and back‑end stay consistent.

3.3 Monetization Mechanisms

In‑App Purchases – Implement a microtransaction service within the local app. Users purchase energy boosts or specialized patterns via a local wallet. Payment handling uses platform APIs (e.g. Apple Pay, Google Pay) but stores purchase tokens locally and anonymizes external transaction data.

Subscription Models – Manage recurring billing through local reminders and payment prompts. Subscriptions auto‑renew only with explicit user consent; the system sends reminders before renewal.

Marketplace Commissions – When a plugin is sold, the transaction splits revenue between the creator and WIRTHFORGE; the split is enforced locally before any funds reach external payment gateways.

Professional Services – Provide packaged support hours and custom features; contracts are negotiated offline.

Community Monetization – Allow users to donate to plugin developers or purchase community badges. Incentives encourage contributions without locking features behind paywalls.

3.4 Value Delivery & Retention Mechanics

Lifetime Value Optimization – Track EU usage, feature adoption, and marketplace purchases to identify upsell opportunities. Use non‑intrusive prompts suggesting relevant upgrades when users consistently max out quotas.

Engagement Loops – Weekly challenges, community events, and leaderboards reward energy‑efficient creations. These loops increase stickiness without encouraging wasteful usage.

Upselling & Cross‑Selling – When a user buys a plugin, suggest complementary add‑ons or higher tiers; ensure offers are tied to actual usage patterns rather than arbitrary sales quotas.

Success Programs – Offer onboarding help, documentation, and community Q&A. For enterprises, assign account managers and provide training sessions.

Loyalty & Rewards – Award points for continuous subscriptions, referrals, and constructive community contributions. Points can be redeemed for extra EUs or marketplace discounts, promoting retention.

3.5 Architecture & Security Considerations

Local-First Billing – All pricing calculations run on the user’s machine; external payment gateways are used only at transaction time. The system never sends energy usage or consumption logs off-device by default
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

Transparency – The UI displays EU usage in real time. Users can view past bills, energy consumption details, and model costs.

No Hidden Fees – All rates and fees are published. The pricing engine code is open source, enabling community audit
raw.githubusercontent.com
.

Privacy & Security – Payment processing uses secure OS APIs and encrypts any stored tokens. No personal billing information is retained beyond what’s necessary to complete transactions.

Section 4: Integration Points

Monitoring System (WF‑OPS‑002) – Provides real‑time energy metrics for billing; ensures EU accuracy and prevents tampering.

Plugin Marketplace (WF‑TECH‑004) – Integrates with pricing engine to handle commissions and developer payouts.

User Progression (WF‑UX‑002) – Tiers and energy budgets align with progression policies; pricing engine respects time-gated unlocks and anti‑gaming rules.

Governance (WF‑FND‑006) – Enforces that payment flows are transparent, respect privacy, and avoid dark patterns.

Support Tools (WF‑BIZ‑003) – Leverages pricing data for targeted marketing and community rewards; ensures marketing messages correspond to genuine value.

Security & Privacy Modules (WF‑TECH‑007) – Provide encryption and secure key management for payment credentials and receipts.

Section 5: Validation & Metrics

Pricing Fairness – Compare monthly revenue to total energy consumed; ensure correlation and detect outliers.

Revenue Growth – Monitor ARPU (average revenue per user) and ARPPU (average revenue per paying user) across tiers.

Conversion & Churn Rates – Track free-to-paid upgrade rates (target: 5–10% per year), subscription renewal rates (target: >70%), and churn (<5% monthly).

Marketplace Adoption – Measure plugin sales volume and average earnings per creator. Aim for at least 30% of active users to make a marketplace transaction in the first year.

Customer Satisfaction – Use surveys and net promoter scores to validate that pricing is perceived as fair and transparent.

Compliance Checks – Run periodic audits to ensure no hidden fees, no unauthorized external data transfers, and adherence to privacy‑preserving payment practices
