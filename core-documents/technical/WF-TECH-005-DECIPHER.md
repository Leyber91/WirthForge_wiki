🎯 Core Objective
Implement Decipher’s real-time compiler loop as the heart of WIRTHFORGE’s engine, converting token-level AI outputs into structured “energy” events at a strict 60 Hz rate with <16.7 ms per-frame processing
GitHub
. In essence, this document specifies how every raw token from the AI model (Layer 2) is ingested by Decipher (Layer 3) and immediately translated into live energy feedback – imagine text turning into lightning – that the user can see and feel in real time. The implementation must achieve this magical conversion reliably within a 16.67 ms frame budget, never dropping frames and maintaining seamless sync with the UI
GitHub
. All core WIRTHFORGE principles guide this design: it runs local-first (entirely on the user’s machine, no cloud or Docker needed), treats energy as computation (every visual output directly ties to a measured token metric), and enforces the 60 Hz frame cadence as an inviolable heartbeat of the system
GitHub
. By the end of this specification, we will have a concrete blueprint – including code stubs, schemas, and tests – for how to build Decipher’s 60 Hz loop in Python (targeting mid-tier hardware), how it maps incoming tokens to Energy Units (EU) in real time, and how it emits frame-by-frame JSON events without ever leaking sensitive data or missing a beat. In short, WF-TECH-005 bridges the gap from concept to code for Decipher: it shows how to make the invisible work of AI visible through efficient, deterministic, and auditable means
GitHub
, delivering an interactive “AI heartbeat” that underpins WIRTHFORGE’s user experience.

📚 Knowledge Integration Checklist

60 Hz Frame Budget Enforcement: Incorporate the 60 Hz timing constraint from WF-FND-002 and WF-META-001 so that Decipher’s loop processes and outputs data within 16.67 ms per frame
GitHub
. The design will ensure the engine can send up to 60 updates per second aligned to this budget, using techniques like workload splitting and frame-skipping to handle bursts without breaking cadence
GitHub
GitHub
.

Energy Formula & Token–EU Mapping: Apply the energy computation formulas defined in WF-FND-002 to convert tokens into Energy Units (EU) in real time
GitHub
. This includes handling velocity (token cadence), certainty (top-K entropy), and friction (stall time) components for each token
GitHub
GitHub
. The implementation must adapt if certain metrics are unavailable (e.g. missing top-K probabilities, using fallback weights)
GitHub
, ensuring a financially adaptive mapping – i.e. scaling energy “cost” to the computational effort of each token – and awareness of special events (e.g. burst or stall tokens trigger immediate energy spikes or drops per definitions in FND-002).

Real-Time Stream Logic (Decipher Core): Build on WF-FND-004’s conceptual design of Decipher as a real-time compiler. We will implement the continuous ingestion of the model’s token stream and its transformation into structured frame-based events
GitHub
GitHub
. Key logic such as the token queue, exponential moving average smoothing, and state-machine handling of generation phases (charging, flowing, stalling, draining) will be carried over from the conceptual blueprint and encoded in Python code. The result is a deterministic pipeline: tokens in → energy out each frame, following the exact sequence and data structures described in the Decipher spec
GitHub
.

Integration with Orchestrator (Tech-001): Ensure Decipher cleanly hooks into the startup and control flow defined in WF-TECH-001. Upon system launch, the orchestrator should initialize Decipher’s loop and trigger a handshake event when ready
GitHub
. Likewise, Decipher will leverage orchestration hooks for things like model start/stop signals, hardware tier detection, and zero-config startup sequence ties. The design respects that the orchestrator runs the main event loop (asyncio) so Decipher’s 60 Hz task will be scheduled there (no separate thread unless necessary, avoiding contention). On startup completion, Decipher sends a startup_complete event with model/tier info via the WebSocket, as specified in Tech-001
GitHub
GitHub
.

WebSocket Protocol Alignment (Tech-003): Conform all output events to the real-time messaging protocol defined in WF-TECH-003. Every frame’s energy update will be packaged as a JSON message (or lightweight binary if indicated) with a proper type (e.g. "energy_update") and schema compliant structure
GitHub
GitHub
. We will use the channel conventions (energy., experience., etc.) from Tech-003
GitHub
 so that the UI can filter and handle messages by category. The implementation will include heartbeats or keep-alive pings as needed (per Tech-003) to monitor connection health during idle frames
GitHub
. In short, if Decipher produces an event (energy spike, token text, interference alert), it will exactly match the message formats and channels expected by the WebSocket layer
GitHub
, ensuring front-end and back-end stay in lockstep.

Local-First & Privacy Preservation: Uphold WF-FND-001’s local-first principle throughout the design
GitHub
. Decipher runs on the user’s machine and never sends data externally – the WebSocket server binds to localhost only, and no cloud endpoints are involved in the core loop
GitHub
. All data in events is abstracted (energies, counts, timestamps) with no raw user text or PII leaking out
GitHub
. Even the AI’s generated tokens, which are sent to the UI for display, travel only over the local WebSocket and are considered transformed content. We will include safeguards that if any remote model usage is configured, Decipher still doesn’t forward anything beyond the abstract metrics (the remote call itself is outside Decipher’s purview)
GitHub
. This checklist item ensures the implementation honors privacy: the “energy stream” visible to the user contains no confidential material, aligning with WIRTHFORGE’s manifesto of transparency and user control.

Hardware Tier Adaptability: Design the loop to be efficient on mid-tier hardware (target environment), while allowing graceful scaling down or up. Citing WF-FND-004 and the manifesto’s performance profiles
GitHub
, Decipher will detect if it’s running on a lower-tier device and automatically simplify its workload (e.g. skip non-essential computations or effects) to maintain frame rate
GitHub
. Conversely on a high-tier machine, it could enable richer calculations (like probability-based resonance) if available. This adaptive approach is built-in: for example, if log-probabilities are not provided by the model (common on limited backends), Decipher will omit entropy-based energy components and rely more on timing (as noted above). The code will also reference a hardware profile (perhaps from Tech-001’s startup data) to tune defaults (particle counts, smoothing factor, etc.) appropriate to the device’s capabilities
GitHub
.

Emergent Phenomena & Progressive Features: Ensure the implementation supports higher-order “emergent” behaviors as described in WF-FND-004 and WF-FND-005. This means the code includes hooks or modules for detecting interference between parallel token streams, resonance patterns (e.g. sustained high confidence producing feedback loops), and energy fields (aggregate effects over time)
GitHub
GitHub
. At Level 1 (single model), these features may be dormant, but the architecture should be ready: e.g. the data structures for multiple concurrent streams, a placeholder in the event schema for resonance data, and conditions in the loop to trigger these analyses only when enabled. By integrating these now, we avoid redesign later – when the user progresses to Level 2+, simply flipping the relevant flags will activate the already-implemented logic. This fulfills the progressive disclosure principle (features unlock as needed)
GitHub
 while keeping the core engine forward-compatible with advanced “AI consciousness” visualization elements.

Structured Event Schema Compliance: Use strict JSON schemas (to be provided) for all events Decipher emits, enforcing consistency and traceability. As part of this, every visual element in the UI has a corresponding data field in Decipher’s output (per WF-FND-001’s WVMP mapping)
GitHub
. For example, if the UI shows a lightning bolt, Decipher’s event includes a numeric value or object representing that bolt’s attributes (thickness, intensity, etc.)
GitHub
. We integrate schema definitions from WF-TECH-003 and FND-004 for event types like energy_update, energy_field, interference_event, etc., and will produce a combined energy.frame schema capturing the full structure of a frame update. The code will generate events that validate against these schemas (using Draft-07 JSON Schema or similar), guaranteeing that the front-end and any logging systems can rely on a stable contract
GitHub
. Any discrepancy or undefined field is treated as a bug. This item ensures terminology and data consistency across layers – Decipher’s “language” (naming and structure) strictly matches the project’s glossary and protocols
GitHub
.

Real-Time Safety, Backpressure & Recovery: Embed robust measures for overload and failure handling, drawing on WF-FND-004’s guidance for frame dropping and backpressure
GitHub
GitHub
. The implementation will include an overload policy: if tokens arrive too fast or processing a frame risks running long, Decipher will drop or coalesce work to stay on schedule (e.g. merge multiple tokens into one frame’s output or skip non-critical calculations)
GitHub
. We will also incorporate heartbeat and reconnect logic from Tech-003: if the UI client disconnects or slows down, Decipher handles it gracefully (pausing output or buffering minimally). Error handling paths are defined for scenarios like JSON serialization failure, model API errors, or extreme slowdowns – each triggering either an errorEvent message to the UI or a controlled self-reset. A testing plan covers simulating these failures to ensure the system remains resilient (no crashes, no uncontrolled delays)

📝 Content Architecture
Section 1: Opening Hook – The 60 Hz Lifeline of AI
Draw in the reader with a vivid scenario connecting Decipher’s real-time loop to the user’s experience. We describe the instant WIRTHFORGE launches: the orchestrator starts the Decipher process, which in turn establishes an invisible 60 Hz “heartbeat” between the AI’s mind and the UI. As soon as the AI begins generating tokens, Decipher catches each one and forges it into a pulse of energy 60 times a second, streaming to the screen. The user, watching the interface, sees not just text output but a synchronized dance of lights and numbers – every token’s impact is rendered as a flash or a spike in an energy graph, updated frame by frame. This section emphasizes why this real-time feedback is crucial: without Decipher, the AI’s work would remain invisible and abstract; with it, WIRTHFORGE makes AI tangible and interactive. We also foreshadow the technical challenges ahead (keeping up with a fast token stream, never overshooting the 16.7 ms budget, handling bursts) to prime the reader for the detailed solutions to follow
GitHub
GitHub
. The goal is to make it immediately clear how WF-TECH-005 will bring AI to life in the interface, one frame at a time.

Section 2: Core Concepts – Frame Loop, Energy Units, and State
Introduce the fundamental concepts underpinning Decipher’s implementation. We break down how Decipher operates as a real-time compiler: it works on a discrete frame loop (60 FPS), meaning all its calculations and outputs repeat every 16.67 ms in lockstep with the UI refresh
GitHub
. We explain the token ingestion pipeline – how tokens stream from the model into Decipher’s input queue immediately as they are produced
GitHub
. From there, the concept of Energy Unit (EU) is defined as the “currency” of computation: using WF-FND-002’s formula, Decipher converts each token’s characteristics (timing, confidence, etc.) into a numerical energy value
GitHub
. This section might revisit, in simpler terms, the components of the energy calculation: velocity (tokens/sec) increases energy, high certainty (low entropy) increases energy, stalls (long pauses) decrease it
GitHub
GitHub
. We illustrate this with a quick example (e.g., a fast token yields E=0.8, a slow uncertain token yields E=0.3). Next, we cover the frame state concept: Decipher doesn’t just compute instantaneous energy, it maintains a running state across frames – e.g., accumulated total energy, a moving average for smoothing (to avoid flicker)
GitHub
, and flags for special conditions (like “stalling” or “burst” as per the energy state machine)
GitHub
GitHub
. We also clarify the privacy boundary here: Decipher deals only in abstracted metrics; token content isn’t needed for energy calculation, so aside from perhaps token length, no semantic data is ingested, aligning with the local-first privacy stance. Finally, the idea of emergent effects is introduced: even though initial implementation might be single-model only, we define concepts like interference (when two streams overlap, causing energy “noise”) and resonance (feedback loops causing sustained high energy) so that the reader knows these concepts exist and the design accounts for them (even if activation comes later)
GitHub
. By the end of this section, the reader should firmly grasp what data Decipher consumes, what it produces, and the real-time constraints and states it operates within – setting the stage for the nuts-and-bolts implementation details.

Section 3: Implementation Details – Real-Time Compiler Loop
Dive into the technical design and algorithms of the Decipher loop. This section starts by outlining the overall architecture in code terms: Decipher will run as an async task within the FastAPI server (or orchestrator process), scheduled at ~60 Hz using an asyncio loop or timer. We present a pseudocode overview of the loop: an endless loop that on each iteration captures the current time, processes any new tokens from the queue into energy values, updates internal state, possibly performs optional analyses (if time permits), and emits an event to the UI, then sleeps or waits until the next frame tick. We illustrate how to schedule this with Python’s asyncio (e.g., using loop.call_later or a periodic asyncio.sleep(frame_interval) inside the loop). The concept of non-blocking operation is emphasized – any heavy computation must be split or optimized so as not to block the event loop. We then break down key sub-components of the implementation:

– Token Queue and Ingestion: When the model produces a token, a lightweight callback (from the Layer 2 integration) enqueues it into Decipher’s thread-safe queue
GitHub
. We describe this queue as having a modest size (to buffer short bursts) and note that if it grows too large (indicative of overload), older tokens might be coalesced or dropped as per the drop policy. This ensures the producer (model) never blocks on Decipher – instead, Decipher will adapt to the flow.

– Frame Processing Logic: Each frame, the loop pulls all available tokens from the queue (or up to a certain max batch) and processes them. If multiple tokens arrived in this frame, it can handle them either sequentially or as a batch – we decide based on performance. For each token, we compute its Energy Unit contribution using the formulas (Section 2). These contributions are summed or otherwise aggregated for the frame. We also update cumulative state: e.g., add to the running total energy count, update the EMA for energy for smoothing, increment token counters, check for any state transitions (if no tokens were received this frame, perhaps check if we have entered a “stall” state, etc.). We highlight that certain computations like EMA smoothing or state machine transitions run every frame even if no token arrived (to decay energy or to eventually signal an end-of-generation)
GitHub
.

– Budget Monitoring and Optional Tasks: A crucial part of the loop is monitoring how much time each frame’s processing takes. We incorporate timestamps to measure elapsed time at key points. Pseudocode is provided, for example:

start = time.time()
process_essential()  # ingestion and energy calc
if time.time() - start < frame_budget * 0.5:
    process_visual_enhancements()  # smoothing, minor effects
if state.resonance_enabled and time.time() - start < frame_budget * 0.8:
    process_resonance_detection()  # higher-order analysis if time allows
emit_event()  # send out the compiled frame data
end = time.time()
if end - start > frame_budget:
    state.overrun_count += 1  # record a missed frame timing


GitHub

We explain this code: it ensures the most essential work (token ingestion and energy calculation) happens first every frame. Optional enhancements (like calculating particle effect details or fine-grained visuals) only run if there’s ample time (e.g. less than 50% of frame budget used)
GitHub
. Higher-cost tasks like resonance detection run only if even more headroom remains and if that feature is enabled
GitHub
. The event emission is always done before frame end. If the frame took longer than the budget, we log an overrun
GitHub
. This structured approach guarantees that in worst-case scenarios we at least produce a basic energy update, even if we had to skip fancy calculations that frame
GitHub
.

– Adaptive Dropping & Backpressure: Building on the above, we detail the graceful degradation policy coded into Decipher. If tokens are arriving too fast for real-time handling, Decipher will start batching them: e.g., if 5 tokens arrived in a single 16 ms window, rather than emitting 5 separate small energy spikes (which isn’t possible at 60 Hz), it might combine them into one larger spike for that frame
GitHub
. We outline a hierarchy of what to drop first under load, inspired by FND-004: (1) drop or simplify high-order analysis (resonance checks off, etc.), (2) simplify visuals (e.g., fewer particles or generic representation), (3) batch multiple tokens into one frame (losing some temporal detail but preserving overall energy), and as a last resort (4) drop some token events entirely if absolutely necessary
GitHub
. The implementation uses the time checks and queue length to make these decisions dynamically each frame. For example, if overrun_count starts increasing or the queue length is consistently >1, the code can automatically start skipping the optional tasks globally or processing multiple tokens at once to catch up. This adaptive loop control is key to never violating the 60 Hz contract.

– State Management: We describe how Decipher maintains state across frames. This includes simple counters (total tokens processed, total energy accumulated) and more complex state like the Energy State Machine (idle, charging, flowing, stalling, drained, etc., as defined in FND-002)
GitHub
GitHub
. We explain that while the implementation doesn’t need a literal state machine diagram coded, it follows the logic: e.g., when a prompt starts, we mark state as “CHARGING”, when first token arrives, transition to “FLOWING”, if a long gap occurs mid-generation, mark “STALLING”, and so forth. These states might influence visual outputs (e.g., UI might show a “stall” icon if in STALLING state). Our code will thus set flags or include state info in events (for instance, an isStalling: true field if we’re in a stall condition). We ensure the state transitions are deterministic and based on measurable quantities (timers, token counts) per FND-002’s recommendations
GitHub
. Additionally, smoothing filters (like EMA for energy) act as state carrying memory of previous frames – we include the α (alpha) parameter and note how it’s tuned (default 0.35 for energy smoothing per FND-002)
GitHub
. All this state logic ensures continuity and meaningful visuals rather than frame-by-frame randomness.

– Tap & Debug Hooks: (Briefly) we mention that for development, Decipher includes a “tap” mechanism (as suggested in conceptual docs) where one can attach a debugger or logger to the stream of events without disrupting it. This could be implemented by having the loop call an observer callback with the event data just before sending, allowing logging to console or file. Such hooks are invaluable for testing and for future modules (like a “record session” feature). We ensure these run in a non-blocking way (e.g., in a separate thread or after sending to UI).

After covering these subtopics, we conclude this Implementation section with a recap of how these pieces work together. We might list bullet points summarizing: the loop uses asynchronous scheduling, buffers input tokens, calculates energy and other metrics, smooths the output, keeps track of running state, and enforces a frame budget with dynamic task management
GitHub
. This comprehensive design shows the reader exactly how to implement Decipher’s 60 Hz compiler in practice, in a way that’s efficient and aligned with the theoretical model.

Section 4: Integration Points – Linking Layers 2, 4, and 5
Describe how Decipher interfaces with the rest of the WIRTHFORGE system. We start with Layer 2 (Model) Integration: when an AI model begins generating tokens, Decipher must receive them in real time. Depending on the architecture, the model could run in the same process (calling Decipher’s API directly) or in a separate process (communicating via an IPC or network stream). We assume the common case of a local model with streaming support. In this scenario, as soon as a user prompt is submitted (likely via a REST API call in Layer 4), the orchestrator triggers the model generation and registers Decipher to consume the stream. For example, using pseudocode: model.generateStream(prompt, onToken=lambda tk: decipher.ingest(tk))
GitHub
. We explain that Decipher’s ingest(token) method simply pushes the token into its queue (as discussed in Section 3). This integration ensures no token is missed: even if multiple tokens arrive within one frame, they’re all queued for processing. We also cover multi-model scenarios: if two models are generating in parallel (e.g., “Council” mode with two AI agents), each token is tagged with an identifier (say, model A or B) when ingested. Decipher can maintain separate sub-states for each source if needed or combine them for interference calculation. The integration is designed such that adding a second stream is straightforward – essentially two callbacks feeding the queue, with tokens labeled by source. We note that synchronization between models (if needed) is handled at a higher level (Orchestrator or Experience Orchestrator in FND-005), so Decipher mainly focuses on merging the streams in a safe way. If one model drastically outpaces the other, normal backpressure and frame skipping policies apply. Additionally, we mention backpressure signals: if Decipher is overwhelmed or the user hits a stop button, Decipher (or the orchestrator) can signal the model to pause/stop generation
GitHub
. For local models this might mean calling a cancellation API or simply not reading further tokens (for remote, sending a stop request). We ensure that the design allows such a signal to propagate quickly to avoid an excessive token backlog.

Next, Layer 4 (WebSocket) Integration: once Decipher has processed a frame, it produces an event object (as described in Section 3) and needs to deliver it to the UI via the real-time channel. We clarify that WF-TECH-003 defines a single WebSocket connection that carries multiple channels of messages, and Decipher’s outputs fall mostly under the energy.* channel (and some under experience.* for token text). The integration here is implementing a call like websocket.send(json.dumps(event)) in the loop, or using FastAPI’s WebSocket broadcast mechanism to send to all connected clients. We emphasize the event schema and give an explicit example of an output JSON structure to show how data is packaged:

{
  "id": "frame-1692300000123",         // unique event ID
  "type": "energy_update",
  "timestamp": 1692300000123,         // epoch ms
  "payload": {
    "newTokens": 2,
    "energyGenerated": 0.65,         // EU in this frame
    "totalEnergy": 12.3,            // accumulated EU so far
    "energyRate": 1.8,              // e.g., smoothed EU per second
    "state": "FLOWING",             // current energy state (e.g., FLOWING)
    "particles": [
       {"type": "spark", "energy": 0.4},
       {"type": "spark", "energy": 0.25}
    ],
    "resonance": null,             // e.g., resonance metrics if any
    "interference": false          // e.g., interference flag
  }
}


This example is illustrative, matching the format defined in Decipher’s conceptual spec
GitHub
GitHub
. We note a few things: the event has a unique ID and timestamp (so the client can track or de-duplicate if needed). The type field categorizes the message (energy_update here). The payload contains exactly the data the UI needs: number of new tokens processed in this frame, how much energy they contributed, the updated total energy, and an energyRate (which might be the EMA or instantaneous rate). We also include a simplified list of particles – each could correspond to a visual effect to render (here two “spark” particles representing the energy bursts). Additional fields like state give the UI contextual info (so it could, say, change a status indicator if state == "STALLING"). If resonance or interference were detected, those fields would carry structured data (or a boolean for simple cases). We stress that this structure will be formalized in the JSON schema deliverable, and Decipher’s code populates these fields reliably each frame.

Implementing the send is straightforward with FastAPI’s WebSocket: we ensure to do it in a non-blocking way (awaiting the send coroutine). If the send operation for a frame is still ongoing when the next frame is ready, we invoke the drop/backpressure logic – i.e., skip sending the next frame or combine frames – to avoid queuing up messages. This behavior was described in Section 3 and aligns with Tech-003 guidance that if a client is slow, the server should not buffer unboundedly
GitHub
. We mention also the heartbeat: either using WebSocket ping/pong frames or a lightweight { "type": "heartbeat", "ts": ... } message every second. Our implementation will include a simple heartbeat that the UI can listen for to detect if the connection is alive (especially during idle periods with no energy or token events).

We then cover Layer 5 (UI) expectations: While this is more on the front-end side, it’s important to note the contract. The UI will interpret Decipher’s events to animate graphics. We reiterate that the UI doesn’t invent any visuals without data – for instance, if Decipher doesn’t send a resonance field, the UI will not show a resonance effect
GitHub
. Therefore, Decipher must send everything needed. This means our implementation should consider any UI elements promised in the design (like “lightning bolt thickness corresponds to token speed” – Decipher should send a value for token speed or directly an intended thickness). The close coordination with UX docs (like WF-UX-001/006) is assumed.

Finally, discuss Integration with Storage and Other Services (briefly, since Tech-006 will detail it): If WIRTHFORGE persists user session data or analytics, Decipher might need to send some data to a database. For example, updating a user’s total energy bank or logging an event for later analysis. We specify that within the 16 ms frame loop, no blocking DB writes occur
GitHub
. If we must record data, we will do so asynchronously – e.g., accumulate events in an in-memory list and have a separate thread or task flush them to a local database every few seconds, or after the session ends. Alternatively, we might use the “tap” mechanism to have a logging subscriber that writes events to a file or NoSQL store as they come, without affecting the main loop. We also mention that any heavy analysis that we chose not to do in real-time (for instance, complex resonance analysis) could be offloaded to a background service or thread that writes its findings back to Decipher’s state (or directly triggers a special event). In all cases, the integration with storage is done carefully to not stall the real-time loop
GitHub
. This might involve using an asynchronous database driver or simply deferring writes. We reference Tech-006 plans (likely using a local MongoDB or JSON file) – Decipher will use an interface or API provided by Tech-006 (e.g., call a function to save energy stats) so that the actual DB details are abstracted. The critical point is that those calls must be non-blocking or very fast. If not, Decipher should perform them outside the frame-critical path (perhaps only on teardown or via callbacks). We ensure that if persistent data is needed (like saving the final totalEnergy at session end), it can be done after stopping the 60 Hz loop or in between generations, where timing is less critical.

By covering these integration points, we demonstrate that Decipher doesn’t live in isolation: it cleanly interfaces upwards to the model layer (ingesting tokens) and downwards to the UI layer (emitting events), and can cooperate with ancillary systems like storage or multi-process setups. The design is flexible enough that Decipher could run in a monolithic application or be part of a microservice architecture (e.g., a dedicated “RealTimeCompilerService”) with minimal changes
GitHub
. We explicitly note that all networking remains local by default (no external communication, unless bridging out is an intentional feature in the future). This section assures the reader that implementing Decipher will not break any existing contracts but rather will fulfill them, acting as the glue between raw AI output and interactive UI feedback.

Section 5: Validation & Testing – Ensuring Performance and Resilience
Outline how we will verify that the Decipher implementation meets its goals and remains robust. First, performance testing: we will create scenarios to measure that the 60 Hz loop can indeed run within budget on target hardware. For example, we can instrument the code to log the duration of each frame (the time from start to emit) and the number of tokens processed. By running a variety of token streams through (slow ones, average ones, artificially bursty streams), we gather data on frame times. We expect on a mid-tier system, normal operation frames use well under 16 ms (perhaps 5–10 ms), leaving headroom for occasional spikes. We’ll specifically test edge cases like a sudden burst of tokens (simulate the model outputting 10 tokens in one 50 ms span) to ensure our drop policy activates: the logs should show that some frames processed multiple tokens and the frame time stayed ~16 ms (instead of ballooning to 30–40 ms)
GitHub
. If any frame exceeds the budget, that’s a failure of this criterion; we iterate by optimizing or tuning the drop policy thresholds until all bursts are handled. We will also test low throughput cases (e.g., model generates very slowly) to ensure we’re not overworking in idle frames and that energy decays smoothly as intended (checking that the half-life decay works).

We plan to use a frame timeline visualization – possibly a simple script to plot frame processing times over a test run
GitHub
. This will help identify if we’re consistently close to the limit or have comfortable margins. If on the graph we see frame times hovering near 16 ms with frequent spikes, we know to tighten the degradation (because we want some margin). Ideally, on mid-tier, we target <12 ms most frames, reserving a few ms for OS jitter or other tasks. On low-tier devices (if we test on one), it might run closer to the edge (maybe 15–17 ms), and we verify that even if occasional frames go slightly over, the user doesn’t perceive stutter (a one-frame miss occasionally out of 60 is usually fine). We’ll document these results and possibly incorporate automated test vectors: e.g., feeding a known token timing sequence through the energy formula offline to ensure the code’s output matches exactly the theoretical values from FND-002 (this checks correctness).

Next, schema and correctness testing: we will use the JSON Schema deliverable to validate that every event emitted is schema-compliant. During development, we can include an assertion or debug mode check that runs each event through the schema validator. Our test suite will cover each event type: e.g., simulate a startup sequence and verify a startup_complete event is well-formed; simulate a normal token flow and validate energy_update events; simulate a multi-model interference scenario (even if just by stubbing data) to produce an interference_event and check its schema. We will also test failure cases: for example, force an error in processing (maybe feed an invalid token that our code doesn’t expect) and ensure an errorEvent is emitted and that the system recovers or at least doesn’t hang. Another test will drop the WebSocket connection in mid-stream (to mimic a user closing the UI) and ensure Decipher either pauses or continues running without a client (depending on design) but certainly doesn’t crash. When the client reconnects, we may test that it can resume receiving events (perhaps via a new handshake or by sending a summary of missed state). These are largely integration tests with Tech-003’s realm, but we include them to validate robustness.

Profiling & Optimization: We will provide instructions on profiling the loop using Python’s profiling tools or timeline analyzers. For instance, running the loop with a test input while using cProfile to identify any function that takes too long. If we find hot spots (e.g., JSON serialization might be heavy), we consider optimizations like pre-serializing certain structures or using a faster library. We also measure memory usage over time to check for leaks (the loop is long-running). Part of validation is running the Decipher loop for an extended period (say an hour of continuous generation) and confirming it doesn’t bloat memory or degrade in performance – if it does, we likely have a state buildup or precision issue (like ever-growing logs or a float precision accumulation). We will document enabling Python’s tracemalloc or similar to catch any object that is accumulating unexpectedly.

Hardware profile testing: Given WIRTHFORGE’s tier approach, we test on at least a mid-tier reference machine (e.g., 4-core CPU, 16 GB RAM, no GPU or a mid GPU). If possible, also test on a low-tier (e.g., 2-core laptop) to see if the frame rate holds or if our adaptive degradation triggers as expected (we expect it to hit the optional tasks skipping more often). We record the differences and ensure the system behavior remains acceptable (perhaps on a very slow machine, frame rate might drop below 60 Hz, but then we document a minimum requirements or see if we can degrade visuals further to compensate).

Edge cases and Error Recovery: We simulate scenarios such as: the model stops unexpectedly (no more tokens when more were expected) – Decipher should detect end-of-stream and transition to a “DRAINED” state gracefully (meaning energy goes to zero over the decay period, and perhaps a final event indicates completion). If the model produces an error (say it crashes), we expect the orchestrator to inform Decipher or Decipher to time-out on token input; either way, Decipher could emit an errorEvent with a message like “Model disconnected” for UI to display. We outline how to recover: the orchestrator might restart the model and Decipher continues with a fresh state or retains state as appropriate. Another scenario: a token arrives with unusual data (maybe non-UTF8 text or some extremely large values). We ensure our code can handle it (since we mostly deal with timing and probabilities, we clamp or validate values to reasonable ranges). If something truly unexpected occurs, Decipher catches the exception (wrapping the main loop processing in a try-except) and logs it, possibly sending an errorEvent to the UI with an error code. The loop would then either skip that frame or restart cleanly. We define a strategy for continuing after an error – for example, if one frame fails, just log and continue next frame, since the system should be resilient.

Finally, we define success criteria for validation: The system should sustain 60 FPS under typical usage on target hardware, never accumulating unbounded lag. All output should be correct and consistent (as per formulas and schemas). The document itself will be checked against the Quality Criteria (below) to ensure we haven’t missed anything in specification. By thoroughly planning these tests and validation steps, we aim to prove that the WF-TECH-005 implementation will meet WIRTHFORGE’s standards in practice, not just in theory.

🎨 Required Deliverables
To fully realize and document the Decipher real-time compiler implementation, we will produce the following deliverables (each as a separate file or module, with suggested filenames):

Documentation Text: The complete technical specification (this document, WF-TECH-005) following the universal template. In addition, a concise executive summary (as a preface or separate “WF-TECH-005-ExecutiveSummary.md”) will be provided for quick reference. The summary will highlight the core design: how Decipher ingests tokens, the 60 Hz loop mechanism, and the guarantee of <16.7 ms frame processing. This helps stakeholders grasp the essence of the implementation at a glance, without delving into full details.

Python Real-Time Loop Code: A reference implementation (or detailed pseudocode) of the Decipher main loop, optimized for real-time performance (e.g. code/WF-TECH-005/decipher_loop.py). This will include the asyncio scheduling setup, the frame handling logic, and inline comments explaining each step. For instance, the code will demonstrate how to schedule a 60 Hz task using FastAPI’s event loop and how to incorporate the drop/degrade checks in code form. By providing this, developers can use it as a starting point or guideline for the actual code integration.

Token-to-Energy Mapping Module: A self-contained module or library (e.g. code/WF-TECH-005/energy_mapper.py) that implements the core energy calculations (E(t) formula from FND-002)
GitHub
GitHub
. This deliverable will contain functions to calculate energy given token timing, optional probability distribution, etc., applying default weights and handling missing data. It will also include any “occasion-aware” adjustments – for example, a function to detect if a token starts a “burst” or “stall” sequence and adjust energy or state accordingly. By modularizing this, the mapping logic can be independently tested (with unit tests using known inputs) and reused across the system (e.g., if later an offline analyzer or a different component needs to compute energy values).

Frame Composer & Emitter: The code responsible for assembling the final event each frame (possibly integrated with the loop code, or separate for clarity). We will provide a sample implementation (e.g. code/WF-TECH-005/frame_composer.py) that takes the current state (new energy, total energy, any effects) and formats a JSON event object according to schema. This will show how to populate each field (including converting timestamps, IDs, etc.) and will be kept in sync with the schema definitions. It may also demonstrate how to use Python’s json or pydantic for ensuring the structure is correct. Having this as a reference ensures no field is overlooked when coding the real system.

Overload Management Policy Definition: Documentation or config snippet describing the drop/degradation policy, possibly as a structured list of rules or pseudocode (could be part of this doc or a separate markdown WF-TECH-005-drop-policy.md). It will summarize the hierarchy: e.g., “If frame is running long, skip resonance; if still long, reduce particle detail; if queue > N, batch tokens; if system still overloads, drop frames”. By explicitly enumerating these, we ensure clarity in what the system will do under stress. This can also be turned into configuration constants or thresholds in the code (which we might list in this deliverable for easy tweaking).

Timing Flow Diagram(s): Visual aids illustrating the runtime behavior. We plan to deliver a Mermaid sequence diagram showing the timeline of events, for example: token generation vs frame emission vs WebSocket send, including conditional paths for normal vs overload scenarios. This could be in a file WF-TECH-005-timing-sequence.mmd (with an accompanying rendered image). Another diagram might depict the state machine of Decipher (idle → charging → flowing → stalling → drained, as per FND-002) in a clear visual format (even though ASCII was given, a diagram is easier to parse). Filename e.g. WF-TECH-005-state-machine.mmd. These diagrams will be referenced in the documentation above to help readers visualize processes like “what happens when 5 tokens arrive in one frame” or “how a prompt lifecycle moves through states with time”.

Queueing & Backpressure Design Note: A short technical note (or section within documentation) focusing on the token queue and backpressure mechanism. This might be delivered as an excerpt or separate file WF-TECH-005-backpressure.md. It will detail how the queue is implemented (size, behavior when full) and how the system signals backpressure (e.g. toggling a flag to slow input, or in future, using model API to throttle). By isolating this topic, we ensure the design is clear on avoiding buffer bloat and maintaining real-time integrity.

JSON Schema Definitions: A machine-readable schema file, e.g. WF-TECH-005-energy-frame.schema.json, containing Draft-07 JSON Schema definitions for all event types Decipher emits. This will cover structures for startup_complete, energy_update (with sub-schemas for particles, etc.), experience.token events (token streams), council.interference and council.resonance events (even if multi-model is future, we include schema now), and errorEvent. Each schema explicitly lists required fields, their types, and allowed ranges where applicable. This deliverable is crucial for cross-checking front-end implementation and for writing validation tests. We may also include example JSON instances for each event type as documentation.

Performance Test Vectors & Results: We will provide either a set of input scenarios with expected outcomes or actual scripts used for performance testing. For example, a JSON or CSV file WF-TECH-005-test-vectors.json might list several token timing sequences (with their inter-arrival times and optional probabilities) along with the expected frame-by-frame energy outputs (computed by an oracle or the formula). These can serve as unit tests for the energy mapping. Additionally, we may include a brief report (WF-TECH-005-performance-results.md) summarizing timing measurements on reference hardware (e.g., “95% of frames under 10 ms, worst-case 16 ms when 5 tokens burst”). This provides evidence that the implementation meets requirements and gives future developers a baseline to compare against when optimizing or modifying the code.

WebSocket Integration Module: Although much of the WebSocket handling is covered in Tech-003, we will include any necessary glue code or configuration to integrate Decipher with the existing FastAPI WebSocket setup. For instance, a snippet file code/WF-TECH-005/ws_binding.py might show how to register Decipher’s loop startup when a WebSocket client connects (ensuring the loop runs only when needed, or always running and just starts sending when a client is there). It would also demonstrate sending multi-channel messages (energy vs experience events). Essentially, this deliverable ensures that nothing is assumed – we explicitly show how Decipher’s outputs are routed into the actual network layer, making the integration concrete and TECH-003 compliant.

Profiling & Optimization Guide: Documentation (e.g. WF-TECH-005-profiling.md) outlining how to profile the Decipher component and tune it. This includes instructions for using Python’s profiling tools on the running system, interpreting the results, and perhaps toggling debug flags to collect frame timings. It will also list known optimization switches (for example, an option to disable particles for performance, or to reduce the resolution of energy values to speed up JSON encoding) that a developer or even user can use if performance is an issue. By providing this guide, we make it easier to maintain and improve the system over time, keeping the 60 Hz promise even as features expand.

Error Handling & Recovery Plan: A document or section (could be WF-TECH-005-error-recovery.md) describing how Decipher handles errors and how to recover gracefully. This includes a list of potential error scenarios (model crash, lost client connection, data format error) and the designed response for each (retry logic, cleanup, user notification via UI, etc.). It also outlines what kind of logging is in place for debugging such issues. Having this as a deliverable ensures the team has a clear playbook when something goes wrong, and it solidifies the error-handling portion of the implementation.

All deliverables will adhere to WIRTHFORGE’s documentation and code standards (filenames using the WF-TECH-005 prefix, JSON files properly formatted, schemas using consistent naming, etc.). By producing these artifacts, we ensure that the Decipher implementation is not just described abstractly but is supported with concrete references and tools – making it easier for engineers to implement, verify, and integrate into the broader WIRTHFORGE system.

✅ Quality Validation Criteria
To confirm that both this document and the planned implementation meet WIRTHFORGE’s requirements, we will evaluate against the following criteria:

Correctness & Completeness: The specification must cover all key scenarios and requirements identified in prior docs (FND-002, FND-004, Tech-001, Tech-003, etc.) with no gaps. We will cross-check that every item mentioned in the Required Deliverables and Knowledge Checklist is addressed in the content. For example, if FND-004 defines certain event types (energy_update, interference_event, etc.), each of those appears here with a clear implementation plan
GitHub
. We also verify that “happy path” and edge cases are both described – not only how the system works under ideal conditions, but also how it handles disconnects, overloads, or missing data (the presence of an error handling section and drop policy is evidence of this completeness). Essentially, by the end of review, there should be no open question like “what if X happens?” that isn’t at least considered or answered in the design.

Alignment with Architecture Principles: The design must strictly follow WIRTHFORGE’s overarching architecture and ethos. During validation, we’ll ensure that local-first is never violated (e.g., check that the spec does not introduce any cloud dependency or unnecessary external communication – indeed we bound everything to localhost as stated)
GitHub
. Layer separation is maintained: Decipher (Layer 3) doesn’t bypass Layer 4 to talk to the UI, it always goes through the WebSocket protocol (Layer 4) as designed
GitHub
. The implementational choices (FastAPI, asyncio) are in line with Tech-001’s no-Docker, native runtime mandate. Also, privacy is considered at every step: we double-check that, for instance, when we described logging or storage, we aren’t inadvertently storing raw user data in events. Any such case would be flagged and revised. The criterion here is met when the implementation can be deployed entirely on a user’s local machine without any external services, and when it naturally fits into the 5-layer model (inputs from L2, outputs to L4/L5, no illegal cross-layer hacks)
GitHub
.

Performance and Frame Timing Justification: The document should not only set performance targets but also justify that they are achievable and how. We will verify that we’ve cited known performance data or included reasoning for each major performance-related decision. For instance, using JSON for events is justified by keeping payloads minimal and the speed of localhost communication
GitHub
GitHub
. The design includes measures to keep within 16 ms (splitting tasks, dropping optional work) – we ensure these are clearly enumerated and reasoned about. If possible, we incorporate preliminary results or analogies (e.g., “WebSocket on localhost can easily handle 60 small messages/sec with sub-millisecond overhead” as known in practice). The presence of the performance test plan and the pseudocode with timing checks indicates we are serious about enforcing the frame budget. This criterion is satisfied when an informed reader can finish the document and say, “Yes, given these designs, I believe 60 Hz is feasible, and there’s a clear way to monitor and maintain it”
GitHub
.

Terminology & Schema Consistency: All terms, event names, and data structures in this doc must be consistent with the WIRTHFORGE glossary and previous documents. We will review terms like “Energy Unit (EU)”, “frame”, “resonance”, “DI (Disagreement Index)”, etc., ensuring they match the definitions in WF-FND-002 and WF-FND-001, or if new, that they are clearly defined here and added to the central glossary
GitHub
. Schema consistency is also crucial: if Tech-003 expects a field totalEnergy (camelCase), we use the exact same casing and format in our examples. Any deviation could cause confusion or bugs. We’ll use the glossary (WF-FND-006/009) as a checklist to make sure, for example, we use “startup_complete” vs “startupComplete” uniformly (the schema file will help enforce this). Meeting this criterion means the documentation reads as part of a unified series – no contradictory definitions, and any developer cross-referencing docs sees a single coherent language across them.

Robustness & Failure Handling: We examine whether the spec fully addresses reliability: What happens when things go wrong? The document explicitly covers failure modes (client disconnect, token flood, missing data, etc.) and provides solutions for each
GitHub
GitHub
. In the quality review, we’ll simulate mentally each failure: e.g., “If the WebSocket drops mid-stream, do we have a reconnection strategy noted? Yes, heartbeat and reconnect were mentioned.” Or “If tokens come too fast, do we risk memory overload? No, drop policy and queue limits are in place.” If any realistic failure isn’t addressed, we’ll update the design to include it. We also ensure that there is no single point of failure unmitigated (for instance, if Decipher crashes, does the orchestrator restart it? Perhaps outside this doc’s scope but likely yes – we might note that orchestrator could monitor it). Logging is part of robustness – the spec notes that key events and errors will be logged, aiding debugging. This criterion is met when the design can handle adverse conditions without catastrophic failure, and these strategies are clearly documented.

Documentation Clarity & Format: Finally, we validate that this document itself is well-structured and clear. It follows the universal template (DNA through Post-Generation) which it does, and uses a logical flow as outlined in Content Architecture
GitHub
. We check that paragraphs are reasonably sized, lists are used for complex points (as we see here), and diagrams or examples are provided where helpful. One would test clarity by giving this document to a new engineer: can they understand the design without constant clarification? We’ve included plenty of contextual cues (for example, starting each section with an overview, using analogies like “AI heartbeat” to cement ideas, giving concrete examples of data structures). We also ensure all cross-references (to other docs or within this doc) are correct and useful. If any section was hard to follow during review, we’ll rewrite for simplicity or break it into bullet points. Meeting this criterion means the document is not only technically sound but also readable and actionable, serving as a solid blueprint for implementation.

By rigorously applying these validation criteria, we will ensure that WF-TECH-005’s final output is of the highest quality – technically accurate, aligned with WIRTHFORGE’s vision, and clearly understandable for the team that will implement and maintain the Decipher module.

📦 Post-Generation Protocol
Once this specification is finalized and approved, a series of follow-up actions will ensure it’s integrated into the WIRTHFORGE project workflow:

Glossary Updates: All new or refined terms introduced (e.g. “energy frame”, specific event names like energy_update, any abbreviations) will be added to the central glossary document (WF-FND-006 or WF-FND-009) for consistency. We’ll make sure terms like Frame, Energy Unit, Resonance are up-to-date with how they’re used in this implementation spec
GitHub
. This maintains a single source of truth for terminology across the project.

Asset Registration: We will update the documentation index/manifest to include WF-TECH-005 and its deliverables. For instance, if there’s a JSON manifest file or wiki index, we add entries for this doc and every deliverable file (code, schema, diagram) so they are tracked. This might involve updating an asset manifest (as was done for Tech-003) and ensuring the files are stored in the designated repository locations (technical docs, code stubs, etc.). Proper versioning labels will be applied to each (e.g., marking the schema with a version or date).

Prototype Implementation & Feedback: Following the spec, a prototype of Decipher’s loop will be coded (if not already in progress). We will use this document as a guide to implement a minimal but functional version of the 60 Hz compiler. This prototype will be used to validate assumptions (especially performance) and we’ll feed the results back into the document if any adjustments are needed (for example, if we discover a certain library call is too slow, we might update the spec to note using a faster alternative). A feedback loop between documentation and prototype ensures the spec remains realistic and achieves the promised performance.

Cascade to UI Implementation: We will coordinate with the UX team (WF-UX-001 and WF-UX-006 documents) to ensure the front-end is prepared to consume the events as specified. Part of the post-gen protocol might be a meeting or report where we walk front-end developers through the energy.frame schema and ensure they understand how to use it. If the UI spec (UX docs) need to be updated to align with any changes in event naming or semantics made here, we’ll do that promptly. Essentially, this spec cascades into implementing the UI’s real-time visualizations (Level 1 “Lightning” effects), so we schedule that work with this document as the reference.

Security Review: Although this is a local system feature, we will conduct a brief security and privacy review. That includes confirming that no sensitive data is persisted or transmitted (which we’ve covered) and that the new code doesn’t introduce vulnerabilities (for example, if we use WebSocket, ensure we handle it over localhost securely, perhaps require auth token if multiple users, etc.). The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps (mentioned in the manifesto) is a guide – we’ll check that, for instance, sending JSON over WS cannot be exploited by a malicious local client (likely not an issue in local scenario, but we consider if any user input could trick the system). If anything flags, we address it (like maybe limiting file writes in logging to avoid filling disk, etc.). This step ensures that implementing Tech-005 keeps the platform secure and user-trusting.

Version Bump & Changelog: We will assign a version number to this spec (e.g., v1.0 at first complete implementation) and update the project’s changelog or versioning file to reflect the addition of WF-TECH-005. If the WIRTHFORGE docs have a changelog entry for each major doc, we’ll add one summarizing what was added. As the implementation progresses, any deviations or improvements from the spec will be recorded and potentially a v1.1 of the spec issued. Maintaining version history allows us to track evolution and revert to design decisions if needed.

Dependency Graph Updates: Finally, we update any dependency or roadmap diagrams (perhaps WF-META-001 diagrams) to show WF-TECH-005’s place now that it’s specified. For example, marking Tech-005 as completed/unblocked (since it was dependent on Tech-001 and Tech-003 which are done) and indicating that Tech-005 now enables Tech-006, UX-001, etc., to proceed. This keeps the overall project plan in sync – showing that the real-time energy loop is designed and paving the way for building out the persistent storage and user interface portions next.

By following this post-generation protocol, we ensure that the WF-TECH-005 specification transitions smoothly from paper to reality, with all teams informed and all project artifacts aligned. The Decipher implementation will then move into the development phase with a clear, shared vision and solid documentation to back it up.

This document leveraged inputs from foundational specs (WF-FND-002, WF-FND-004) and technical bridges (WF-TECH-001, WF-TECH-003) to create a comprehensive implementation plan for WIRTHFORGE’s Decipher module. By adhering to the universal template and core principles throughout, it ensures the resulting system is faithful to WIRTHFORGE’s vision – making AI’s energy visible in real-time, on local hardware, at a rock-solid 60 FPS.
