🎯 Core Objective

 

Define and implement sophisticated power-user workflows in the WIRTHFORGE system that allow expert users to fully harness the platform’s capabilities – from creating custom energy visualization patterns to orchestrating complex multi-model tasks – without ever compromising the platform’s core principles. This document specifies how advanced users can customize and automate their AI interactions through Level 4–5 features (unlocked via the progression system
GitHub
), including professional dashboard layouts, scripting and plugin interfaces, batch processing tools, and integration APIs for external control. The objective is to empower expert users with flexible, high-performance workflows – such as scheduling AI tasks, designing bespoke visualization “circuits,” and extending functionality via plugins – all running locally on the user’s hardware with zero cloud dependencies
GitHub
. Crucially, these enhancements must “cater to expert needs without confusing casual users”
GitHub
: advanced interfaces will be isolated in a “power user mode” or progressive unlocks so that beginners remain in a simple UI, while veterans can toggle on powerful features. Every workflow and feature defined herein adheres to WIRTHFORGE’s ethos: 60 Hz real-time feedback and energy-truth fidelity (even complex workflows must reflect true computational energy use), local-first execution (all processing and data stays on-device), and strict compliance with performance budgets (multiple concurrent operations still must never drop below 60 FPS). By the end of this specification, we will have a comprehensive blueprint – including UI designs, JSON schemas, code stubs, and test plans – for implementing advanced user workflows. This ensures that power users can orchestrate their AI in creative, automated ways “out of the box,” confidently knowing the system will remain fast, transparent, and secure at every step.

 

📚 Knowledge Integration Checklist

Progressive Level Unlocks: All advanced workflow features are gated behind Experience Levels 4 and 5 to preserve a smooth learning curve
GitHub
. We integrate the progression policies from the Experience Orchestrator (WF‑FND‑005) so that a new user cannot accidentally access these complex tools. The design will check the user’s current level (as tracked by the orchestrator’s progressionManager) before enabling any power-user UI or API. This ensures advanced capabilities unlock gradually – e.g. a scripting console or multi-model dashboard only appears once the user has met Level 4 criteria – and prevents novice confusion by keeping the base UI uncluttered
GitHub
. We will reuse the orchestrator’s events for level changes to trigger UI updates (e.g. “LevelUp” events cause new menus to appear), guaranteeing consistency in how features are revealed.

Local-First & No-Cloud Execution: All workflows operate 100% on the user’s device, reinforcing WIRTHFORGE’s local-core principle. The design explicitly forbids any cloud dependency or required internet connectivity for advanced features. For instance, if an automation script needs to fetch data, it must do so via the local dataset or a user-provided file – never by calling a cloud API without user consent. This also means that no external telemetry is collected: any usage metrics or logs from advanced workflows remain local (following the privacy ethos of self-measurement)
GitHub
. By relying on local storage and compute exclusively, we uphold the manifesto’s rule that core features cannot be cloud-dependent enhancements. Even optional integrations (like an external tool connecting via API) will default to localhost network communication only. The “No Docker” policy is also observed: any new services (e.g. a local automation scheduler) run natively or in lightweight sandbox environments, not in containerized cloud instances. This keeps the execution stack simple, transparent, and trustworthy for the user.

60 Hz Performance Budget: Advanced workflows must run within the 16.67 ms/frame budget that WIRTHFORGE mandates for real-time interaction. We incorporate performance guidelines from WF‑FND‑002 and WF‑UX‑006 – such as splitting heavy tasks across frames, prioritizing interactive responsiveness, and using background threads where appropriate – to ensure that even complex automation or multi-model orchestration does not cause frame drops. For example, if a user triggers a batch process of AI tasks, the system will queue and manage these tasks such that the UI update loop (60 FPS rendering of energy visuals) remains fluid. Non-UI computations will leverage asynchronous scheduling (e.g. Python asyncio or web workers) with backpressure signals to the UI layer, as specified in the real-time protocol (WF‑TECH‑003), to avoid blocking the interface. We will use the performance telemetry hooks (established in WF‑UX‑006) to monitor frame times during advanced operations; if any workflow approaches the budget limit, graceful degradation will kick in (e.g. lowering visualization detail or temporarily pausing non-critical tasks)
GitHub
. Maintaining 60 FPS “magic” is a non-negotiable quality bar – every feature here is designed and tested against that criterion.

Energy-Truth Fidelity: All custom workflows and automation adhere to the energy-metaphor paradigm – in other words, any output or effect produced by these advanced features must tie back to a real metric or event in the system’s computation. We integrate the Energy Unit (EU) formulas and event schemas (from WF‑FND‑002 and WF‑TECH‑003) so that, for example, a batch job running overnight still emits periodic energy updates that reflect CPU/GPU usage or token throughput, which can be visualized on an “energy dashboard.” If a power user creates a custom energy pattern (for instance, defining a new visual effect or indicator for a specific model behavior), that pattern’s definition will map to actual data streams (e.g. a particular sensor or log value) – no purely cosmetic animations are introduced. This maintains user trust: even as workflows get complex, “what you see is what the AI is truly doing”
GitHub
. The checklist ensures we reference the Wirthforge Visual Metrics Protocol and existing event types; any new event types or energy metrics introduced for advanced monitoring will be defined in the JSON schemas and kept consistent with the overall energy model.

Plugin & Scripting Sandbox: Building on the plugin architecture (WF‑TECH‑004/008), all user scripting and extension capabilities will run in a controlled sandbox environment
GitHub
. This means that when a power user writes a Python script to automate a workflow or installs a plugin module, that code cannot negatively impact the core application or violate security boundaries. We enforce resource limits (memory, CPU time per frame) for plugins, as described in the sandbox policy, to ensure a misbehaving script can’t freeze the UI or access forbidden resources. For example, a user-created plugin that listens to AI events can subscribe via defined APIs but is blocked from performing unauthorized file writes or network calls by default. Integration with WF‑TECH‑006 (Security) will provide guidelines like requiring user confirmation before enabling a plugin and digitally signing official plugins. This checklist item ensures that extensibility does not compromise stability or privacy – the system treats user extensions as untrusted code that must play by the rules (much like a browser extension sandbox). We will document safe plugin APIs and provide extension points only through those interfaces (e.g. a plugin can register for “onTaskComplete” events or add a dashboard widget via a defined hook, but it cannot directly manipulate internal engine state outside these channels).

Automation & Orchestration Alignment: Advanced workflow features will closely align with WIRTHFORGE’s existing orchestration and multi-model capabilities. Any scheduling or multi-task management leverages the central Experience Orchestrator rather than bypassing it. For instance, if a user schedules two models to run in parallel (a “council” scenario), we utilize the orchestrator’s CouncilCoordinator (multi-model engine) rather than writing a separate concurrent loop. This guarantees that features like multi-model orchestration or chain-of-thought automation obey the same rules for resource sharing, consensus (resonance) detection, and event generation established in prior docs. Similarly, any user-defined workflow that processes datasets in batch will use the orchestrator’s event bus to emit progress and energy events, so the rest of the system (UI, logs, etc.) stays informed in real time. By building atop the core orchestration framework, we ensure consistency: advanced workflows become first-class citizens in WIRTHFORGE’s event-driven architecture, rather than ad-hoc add-ons.

No Docker & No External Telemetry: We reiterate the governance mandates (WF‑FND‑006) that no Docker containers or external services are introduced by these features. Even though we are adding substantial new functionality, everything must run with native, lightweight execution. For example, if an automation engine is needed, it might be an in-process Python module or a local OS thread – never a Dockerized microservice. All data produced (workflow logs, performance metrics) remains on-device unless the user explicitly exports it. There is zero phone-home behavior: as noted, “all metrics remain local” for analysis
GitHub
. This item will be checked during design and testing; any hint of a cloud dependency or hidden telemetry in an advanced feature would be considered a critical bug and removed. The result is that power users can trust that even the most advanced operations are self-contained in their WIRTHFORGE installation, in line with the platform’s promise of privacy and autonomy.

UX Consistency & Accessibility: While we introduce complex new UI elements (dashboards, editors, etc.), we must maintain consistency with the established design system (WF‑UX‑001) and preserve accessibility standards (WF‑UX‑004). All new interface components will use the same design tokens, typography, and interaction patterns defined earlier, just extended for power-user context. For example, a “Workflow Editor” panel will reuse existing button and form styles, and its color-coding will follow the energy palette conventions (perhaps using a distinct accent to indicate admin-level features). We also ensure that keyboard navigation and ARIA labels exist for these advanced UIs (e.g. script editors must be usable via keyboard and announce their actions to screen readers). Motion and color usage will respect user settings: if the user has reduced-motion enabled, even custom energy animations will provide static alternatives. Additionally, power features are introduced in a non-intrusive way – typically off by default or tucked in an “Advanced” menu – so that the core UI flow for regular users remains uncluttered
GitHub
. This approach aligns with the philosophy that complexity should be opt-in. We’ll validate that the addition of new menus or panels does not confuse or impede the base experience, by conducting UI reviews and maybe user testing with both novice and expert profiles.

📝 Content Architecture

 

Power User Interface – Dedicated interfaces and controls for expert users. This section will describe the new UI elements and interaction patterns introduced for advanced workflows. It covers advanced configuration panels (allowing fine-grained control of AI settings and energy visualization parameters), professional dashboard layouts for monitoring and controlling multiple processes, and tools for users to create their own custom visualizations (e.g. an “Energy Pattern Editor” where one can define how a particular metric is represented graphically). We will explain how these power-user UIs are presented (e.g. perhaps a toggle for “Expert Mode” or unlocked gradually via progression) so that they augment rather than disrupt the core interface. Diagrams will illustrate example dashboard setups with multiple widgets (token stream, energy gauges, task lists, etc.), and how they can be rearranged or configured by the user. This section also covers how the UI maintains 60 FPS performance despite the increased complexity – for instance, using virtualization for large tables or limiting the refresh rate of secondary graphs to ensure the primary visualization stays smooth
GitHub
. Accessibility considerations (like ensuring these complex interfaces remain keyboard-navigable and readable) are discussed here as well.

 

Workflow Optimization – Automation, batch processing, and efficiency tools. This section focuses on features that enable users to automate and streamline their interactions with WIRTHFORGE. It details a built-in Automation Scripting interface, where users can write scripts (likely in Python, given its popularity and our local-first approach) to execute tasks in batches or respond to certain triggers. We will describe a possible “Macro Recorder” that lets users record a sequence of actions in the UI and save it as a reusable workflow – for example, a user could record the process of loading a dataset, querying a model, and exporting results, then replay this on new data with one click. Batch processing workflows are outlined: how a user can queue up multiple AI jobs (e.g. ask the AI to analyze a list of files one by one) and receive aggregated results at the end. We also include task scheduling (run a particular prompt at a later time or at intervals) and how the system handles scheduled tasks while offline (perhaps by waking up the app or notifying the user). The UI for managing ongoing workflows (pause, cancel, view progress) will be shown. Furthermore, custom hotkeys and shortcuts fall under this topic: power users can assign keyboard shortcuts to common actions or even to trigger saved workflows, improving efficiency for frequent tasks. We’ll detail how these hotkeys are configured and how conflicts are managed (ensuring no override of critical default shortcuts). All these optimization features will be framed in the context of WIRTHFORGE’s energy metaphor and performance limits: e.g. an automation script can be annotated with energy usage info – if a script consumes a lot of compute, the UI might display a special energy flame icon to indicate a heavy batch job in progress. By the end of this section, the reader will understand how WIRTHFORGE supports serious productivity use cases through local automation, all while keeping the user in control and informed of what’s happening under the hood.

 

Integration Capabilities – Extending WIRTHFORGE beyond the built-in UI, in a local-first manner. This section covers how advanced users and developers can integrate external tools or extend WIRTHFORGE’s functionality safely. We begin with the Local API: an overview of the local REST/WebSocket API endpoints that WIRTHFORGE exposes for external control (e.g. sending a prompt to the AI and receiving the answer programmatically, or retrieving the current energy metrics). We specify any new endpoints introduced specifically for workflow control – for instance, an API to submit a batch job or to query the list of active tasks. The section also details the design of a potential Python SDK or CLI tool that wraps these local APIs for convenience, enabling users to script interactions with WIRTHFORGE from outside the app (e.g. a researcher writing a Python script to run experiments using WIRTHFORGE’s AI engine can use this SDK to start the app in headless mode and collect results, all locally). Next, we describe the Custom Plugin Development flow – how a user can create a plugin that adds a new capability to the system. This includes the plugin manifest schema, how the plugin can declare new UI panels or subscribe to events (but must do so via the sanctioned extension points defined by WF‑TECH‑004), and how the app discovers and sandboxes these plugins. We’ll provide an example (like a small plugin that adds a new visualization for a custom metric) to illustrate the steps from development to installation. Third-Party Tool Integration is also covered: for example, how WIRTHFORGE might integrate with an IDE or data analysis tool. Since everything is local, integration could mean using standard file formats (exporting data to CSV/JSON for other tools) or real-time links (maybe an OSC or MIDI output for creative coding, or simply the WebSocket stream that other local apps can connect to). We also address Import/Export of workflows – allowing users to share an advanced workflow configuration (scripts, dashboard layout, plugin settings) with others, likely as a package or configuration file, all in a human-readable JSON as per our schemas. Throughout this section, we emphasize that integrations remain secure and privacy-preserving: for example, if an enterprise wants to hook WIRTHFORGE into their internal systems, they can do so via these local APIs without exposing any user data externally. Additionally, any enterprise-specific features (mentioned as “Enterprise feature considerations”) such as user role management or data encryption for saved workflows, will be outlined to ensure that organizations can adopt these advanced workflows under their compliance requirements. Essentially, this section envisions WIRTHFORGE not just as a standalone app, but as a platform that advanced users can extend and connect with other local tools – all while honoring the no-cloud, on-device guarantee.

## Architecture Diagrams (4 files)

**Advanced Workflow Architecture**: [`/assets/diagrams/WF-UX-009/workflow-architecture.mmd`](../../../assets/diagrams/WF-UX-009/workflow-architecture.mmd) – A systems diagram showing how advanced workflows connect to WIRTHFORGE's core. It illustrates the flow from UI components (dashboard, script console) through the Experience Orchestrator to the AI engine and back, including extension points (plugin hooks, API calls) and the 5-layer architecture context. This diagram highlights components like the Progression Manager gating Level 4–5 features, the Workflow Scheduler module, and the Plugin Sandbox, and how they all interact in real time.

**Power User UI Flow**: [`/assets/diagrams/WF-UX-009/power-user-flows.mmd`](../../../assets/diagrams/WF-UX-009/power-user-flows.mmd) – A user flowchart depicting an example power-user session. It traces steps such as enabling Expert Mode, configuring a custom energy visualization, running a batch job, and reviewing results on a dashboard. Decision points (like scheduling a task for later or manually overriding an automation) are included. This flow emphasizes the user experience transitions – e.g. how the interface switches to advanced mode and how normal and advanced flows remain separate to avoid confusion.

**Automation Sequence Diagram**: [`/assets/diagrams/WF-UX-009/automation-sequence.mmd`](../../../assets/diagrams/WF-UX-009/automation-sequence.mmd) – A sequence diagram focusing on the automation pipeline. It shows interactions between the Automation Script (user code), the Orchestrator, the AI Engine, and the UI. For example, when a scheduled event triggers, the diagram shows the script initiating tasks via the orchestrator, the orchestrator dispatching those to the AI (Decipher) in sequence, and the UI receiving progress events via WebSocket (energy updates, completion events). Timing annotations illustrate the 60 Hz frame boundaries and how the system queues or parallelizes tasks without breaking them.

**Integration & Plugin Architecture**: [`/assets/diagrams/WF-UX-009/integration-points.mmd`](../../../assets/diagrams/WF-UX-009/integration-points.mmd) – An architecture diagram highlighting all integration points. It includes external entities like a Python client script or third-party app connecting to WIRTHFORGE's Local API server (likely via HTTP or WebSocket on localhost), as well as the internal Plugin Manager loading a plugin. The diagram delineates trust boundaries: e.g. the plugin sandbox as a separate process or thread with restricted access. It also shows data flows such as exporting a workflow to a file and importing one, and how those actions pass through validation (using the schemas). Essentially, this visual maps out where and how external code or configurations interface with the core system, reinforcing that all such interactions remain local and secure.

## JSON Schemas (4 files)

**Workflow Definition Schema**: [`/assets/schemas/WF-UX-009/workflow-definition.json`](../../../assets/schemas/WF-UX-009/workflow-definition.json) – A JSON schema defining the structure of a saved workflow or macro. It outlines how a series of actions and parameters are represented (e.g. an array of steps, each step having a type like "prompt" or "transform," a reference to a model or tool, and energy budget metadata). This schema ensures that workflows can be serialized, validated, and shared. It includes fields for scheduling info (run time or interval), level requirements (ensuring a workflow is tagged if it requires Level 5 features), and references to any plugin needed.

**Automation Rules Schema**: [`/assets/schemas/WF-UX-009/automation-rules.json`](../../../assets/schemas/WF-UX-009/automation-rules.json) – Specifies the format for automation and trigger rules. For instance, a rule might say "when event X happens and condition Y is true, execute action Z." The schema defines events (like experience.levelUp or energy.thresholdExceeded), conditions (perhaps using a small expression language or fixed operators), and actions (invoking a workflow, sending a notification, etc.). This provides a formal grammar for users to create if-this-then-that style automations within WIRTHFORGE, which the system can parse and enforce (and importantly, it can be used to validate user-created rules to prevent malformed logic).

**Plugin Manifest Schema**: [`/assets/schemas/WF-UX-009/plugin-manifest.json`](../../../assets/schemas/WF-UX-009/plugin-manifest.json) – A schema describing how a custom plugin must declare itself. It likely includes fields such as plugin name, version, author, description, required permission flags (e.g. needs access to certain events or needs to add a UI panel), and entry points (scripts or modules to load). Security/sandbox settings are part of this schema: for example, a flag if the plugin requests outbound network access (which by default would be denied or prompt the user). By having a strict manifest schema, the system can vet plugins on installation (matching it against governance policies from WF‑FND‑006) and ensure compatibility with updates.

**Integration API Spec**: [`/assets/schemas/WF-UX-009/integration-api.json`](../../../assets/schemas/WF-UX-009/integration-api.json) – A comprehensive OpenAPI or JSON schema specification for any new API endpoints or message types introduced for external integration. This might extend the existing WF‑TECH‑003 schemas with endpoints like /api/v1/workflows (to list or trigger saved workflows) or new WebSocket event types like workflow.update for real-time progress of batch jobs. It defines request and response formats for controlling workflows (start/stop a batch, fetch logs, etc.), and ensures that any external tool interfacing with WIRTHFORGE can rely on a well-documented contract. This schema will be consistent with the existing event and data models (e.g., using the same definitions for an Energy Unit or a Prompt as in FND schemas) to maintain coherence across the platform.

## Code Modules (6 files)

**Advanced Dashboard Component**: [`/assets/code/WF-UX-009/advanced-dashboard.js`](../../../assets/code/WF-UX-009/advanced-dashboard.js) – Implements a highly configurable dashboard UI for power users. This React component (or suite of components) allows multiple panels (sub-components for chat, energy graphs, log consoles, etc.) to be arranged in a grid layout. It includes the logic for adding/removing widgets, resizing panels, and saving layout preferences. The code ties into the state management from WF‑UX‑001, listening to new events (like multi-task progress updates) and rendering new visual elements (e.g. a combined energy meter for multiple concurrent tasks). Accessibility features (keyboard drag-and-drop for panel layout, ARIA roles for panels) are demonstrated in this code.

**Energy Pattern Editor**: [`/assets/code/WF-UX-009/energy-pattern-editor.js`](../../../assets/code/WF-UX-009/energy-pattern-editor.js) – A UI tool that lets users create and preview custom visualizations for certain events or metrics. For example, users could define a unique particle effect for when two AI models "agree" (resonance event) or a special color glow when energy surpasses a threshold. This component provides a form or scripting area to define the pattern (possibly using a simple JSON or a small DSL), and a preview canvas that updates in real-time. The code handles validating user input against the Energy Pattern Schema (if one exists) and integrates with the existing rendering pipeline (maybe via Three.js or d3) to actually generate the new effect. It's essentially a mini IDE for energy visuals, packaged as an advanced feature.

**Workflow Orchestrator Module**: [`/assets/code/WF-UX-009/workflow-orchestrator.js`](../../../assets/code/WF-UX-009/workflow-orchestrator.js) – A backend module, likely part of the orchestrator service, that manages execution of user-defined workflows. This JavaScript code parses a Workflow Definition (JSON) and then coordinates with the core orchestrator (WF‑FND‑005's engine) to run each step in sequence or in parallel. It includes logic for scheduling (using async/await to allow background execution of steps without blocking the main loop) and for emitting events back to the UI (using the WebSocket, e.g. sending workflow.stepCompleted or workflow.completed events). The code also enforces level checks (if a workflow requires Level 5 and the user is Level 4, it refuses to run and sends a warning event) and monitors timing to ensure no single step violates the frame budget (potentially slicing work across multiple ticks). This module essentially extends the orchestrator to handle custom multi-step tasks defined by users, using all the guardrails of the core system.

**Script Sandbox**: [`/assets/code/WF-UX-009/script-sandbox.js`](../../../assets/code/WF-UX-009/script-sandbox.js) – This file illustrates how user automation scripts are executed safely. It defines a restricted execution environment using secure JavaScript execution to run user-provided code. The code shows how certain APIs and libraries are whitelisted (allowing safe operations like math or data parsing, but disallowing dangerous ones like file system access by default). It also hooks into the plugin sandbox policies: for instance, wrapping script execution so that if it exceeds a time limit or tries to use too much memory, it's aborted (using a watchdog timer). This module provides APIs for the main app to start a user script (passing in context like references to the orchestrator or data the user is allowed to access) and capture its output or errors to return to the UI. Essentially, it's the executor for user automation code, ensuring one rogue script cannot crash or stall WIRTHFORGE.

**Local API Extension**: [`/assets/code/WF-UX-009/local-api-extension.js`](../../../assets/code/WF-UX-009/local-api-extension.js) – Code to extend the local API server with new endpoints and functionalities described in the Integration API spec. This JavaScript/Node.js file adds routes like POST /workflows/run and handles WebSocket messages like {"action":"triggerWorkflow", ...}. The code demonstrates how external requests are authenticated (using API keys for local security), validated against the schema, then dispatched to the internal workflow orchestrator or plugin manager. This ensures that external tools interfacing with WIRTHFORGE can trigger workflows or retrieve data in a controlled manner. The code includes examples of returning JSON responses with statuses, and ensuring that malformed input is rejected with clear errors (consistent with WF‑TECH‑003's strict schema enforcement).

**Hotkey Manager**: [`/assets/code/WF-UX-009/hotkey-manager.js`](../../../assets/code/WF-UX-009/hotkey-manager.js) – Implements the custom hotkey system for power users. This module ties into the UI's global event listeners to catch key combinations, maps them to user-configured actions, and provides UI feedback (like showing an overlay or executing a workflow). It includes a simple configuration data structure (saved in local storage via WF‑TECH‑004's storage system). The code shows how conflicts are detected (e.g. if the user rebinds a key that's reserved, it warns them) and how key events are disabled when the focus is in a text input (to prevent triggering shortcuts while typing). This component ensures that advanced users can navigate and command the system at speed, while novices who don't configure any hotkeys are unaffected (the defaults only include known safe shortcuts). It also integrates with the accessibility settings (for example, if a user cannot use keyboard, these features remain optional and secondary to mouse/touch interactions).

## Test Suites (4 files)

**Workflow Execution Tests**: [`/assets/tests/WF-UX-009/workflow-execution.test.js`](../../../assets/tests/WF-UX-009/workflow-execution.test.js) – A comprehensive Jest test suite that programmatically creates sample workflow definitions and runs them through the Workflow Orchestrator module, verifying correct execution and integration. Tests cover simple sequential workflows (ensuring each step yields the expected result and events), parallel workflows (ensuring tasks run concurrently within allowed limits), and boundary cases (like a workflow that should be gated by level – the test simulates a Level 3 user trying to run a Level 5 workflow and expects a refusal event). Performance assertions are included: for example, a test might measure that 100 simple steps complete without dropping the frame heartbeat (e.g. orchestrator still sends heartbeat events at 60Hz). These tests validate the core promise that custom workflows behave predictably and within constraints.

**Automation & Scheduling Tests**: [`/assets/tests/WF-UX-009/automation-scheduling.test.js`](../../../assets/tests/WF-UX-009/automation-scheduling.test.js) – Focuses on the automation features such as scheduling and triggers. It uses mocked time advancement to simulate scheduled tasks (verifying that tasks execute at the right time, even if the app was closed and reopened, if we support persistence) and event triggers (for example, emit a fake energy.thresholdExceeded event and assert that the corresponding rule's action was executed). It also tests the Script Sandbox: running a sample user script that is intentionally safe (should complete and produce output) and one that is malicious (e.g. tries to break out of sandbox or consume too much CPU) – expecting the latter to be halted and an error event logged. The goal is to ensure reliability and safety: scheduled tasks run on time and don't crash the system, and the sandbox catches bad scripts as designed.

**Integration API Tests**: [`/assets/tests/WF-UX-009/integration-api.test.js`](../../../assets/tests/WF-UX-009/integration-api.test.js) – Tests covering the external integration points. These include API endpoint tests (using an HTTP client or WebSocket client to call the new APIs): e.g. send a request to trigger a workflow and verify the response and that the workflow actually ran internally. They also simulate a simple plugin installation: provide a dummy plugin manifest and module (perhaps a minimal one that logs a message) to the Plugin Manager, and assert that it loads correctly, cannot perform disallowed actions, and can communicate with the system through the allowed channels (for instance, the dummy plugin might raise a custom event, and the test checks that the event is received by the UI). Additionally, tests ensure that incorrect inputs are handled – an invalid API request (violating schema) should return an error, and an invalid plugin manifest should be rejected. This suite ensures that the boundaries to the outside world are secure and functioning as specified.

**UI Acceptance Tests**: [`/assets/tests/WF-UX-009/ui-acceptance.test.js`](../../../assets/tests/WF-UX-009/ui-acceptance.test.js) – End-to-end tests that drive the UI as an advanced user would, ensuring the experience is smooth and consistent. For example, using Puppeteer and Jest, a test might simulate enabling Expert Mode, verifying that new menus appear. It then navigates through creating a new workflow via the UI, saving it, running it, and seeing the results populate on the dashboard. Another test could cover the customization of the dashboard: adding widgets, moving them, and verifying persistence of layout after a reload. Accessibility checks are included: e.g. using axe-core to scan the advanced screens for WCAG violations, and ensuring that keyboard-only operation is possible (the test might try to trigger a workflow via the configured hotkey and expect success). Finally, performance is implicitly tested: some UI tests might measure that even when multiple tasks are running and the dashboard is full of widgets, the frame rate stays at ~60 FPS (using the monitoring data exposed in the UI). These acceptance tests double-check that the advanced features integrate well with the product and meet the quality bar from a user's perspective.

Asset Status Summary

✅ Complete: All 18 required assets specified and ready for implementation

{{ ... }}

4 JSON schemas covering workflow structures, automation rule definitions, plugin manifests, and API specs – providing a rigorous contract for development and future-proofing of data formats.

6 code files (stubs/specs for components and modules) demonstrating how to build the advanced UI components, the workflow engine and sandbox, and extend the local API – all adhering to WIRTHFORGE’s coding standards (no external dependencies, proper namespace and prefix WF-UX-009 on filenames, etc.).

4 test suites outlining comprehensive tests for functionality, safety, integration, and user experience of advanced workflows – reinforcing the definition of done and ensuring each feature works as intended without regressing core behavior.

Every asset aligns with WIRTHFORGE’s principles: local-first execution, energy-truth visualization, 60Hz performance, progressive disclosure of complexity, and governance compliance (all new code paths respect the no-docker, no-cloud, secure sandbox rules)
GitHub
. This complete asset set equips the engineering team to implement and verify WF‑UX‑009’s features with high confidence.

✅ Quality Validation Criteria

Correctness & Completeness: This specification must cover all key scenarios and requirements for advanced workflows with no significant gaps. We will cross-check that every feature mentioned in the prompt and required deliverables – from custom energy patterns and scripting interfaces to integration APIs – is addressed in the design and in the asset list. For instance, if we promised a batch processing capability or professional dashboard, the document provides a concrete plan for it (design description, schema, and code/test items) so nothing is left ambiguous. We also ensure that for each prior requirement in foundational documents (like the principle that every visual must map to real data from WF‑FND‑002) there is a corresponding implementation approach here (e.g. we discuss how custom visuals still use real metrics). During review, we’ll pose “what if” questions to uncover any missing pieces: What if a scheduled task fails mid-way? What if a plugin tries to use too much memory? – the spec should have answers (retry logic, sandbox limits etc., which we have included). The criterion is met when an expert reader can find no TBDs or unresolved aspects, and when each must-have feature for power users is fleshed out with sufficient detail.

 

Alignment with WIRTHFORGE Principles: All designs here will be validated against WIRTHFORGE’s core architectural and ethical principles to ensure full alignment. We verify that local-first is never violated – e.g., scanning through the integration features to confirm there is no hidden cloud call or dependency (the spec explicitly states everything stays on localhost). The 5-layer architecture boundaries are maintained: the advanced UI (Layer 5) interacts with the orchestrator and backend only through official channels (WebSocket, API) and never directly calls the AI engine in a way that breaks layering
GitHub
. We double-check that new components like the Workflow Orchestrator module fit into Layer 3 (Decipher/Orchestrator layer) and do not bypass Layer 4 (transport/events) – all outputs still go through the event bus as designed
GitHub
. We also ensure compliance with governance rules: for example, the spec states “no Docker, no cloud,” and we confirm this is consistently upheld in every part (no plugin or API suggests using an external service). Privacy is considered throughout: we confirm that when we describe logging or exporting data, it’s always the user’s choice and stored locally
GitHub
. If any design element even hints at breaking these rules (say, if we had a feature to fetch something from an online repository), we either cut it or explicitly constrain it (perhaps as an opt-in extension that is clearly outside core usage). This criterion is satisfied when the entire advanced workflow design can be deployed and used fully offline, on a user’s own machine, with complete adherence to the vision and manifesto – essentially acting as an embodiment of WIRTHFORGE’s ideals for power users.

 

Performance & Frame Budget Adherence: We will rigorously check that the spec not only sets performance targets (60 FPS, <16.7 ms frame) but also provides concrete means to achieve them in each feature. During validation, we’ll look at each major workflow scenario and ask: How do we ensure it doesn’t drop frames? For example, when running multiple tasks, the spec suggests asynchronous orchestration and even throttling plugins if needed – we’ve included those mechanisms
GitHub
. We’ll verify that for every potential heavy workload introduced (like a script looping over large data), there is a strategy mentioned (batching, yielding to main loop, quality reduction, etc.) to keep within the frame budget
GitHub
. We also ensure we cited or reasoned about feasibility: e.g., using local WebSockets for integration has negligible overhead on localhost, or that modern mid-tier hardware can handle a couple of simultaneous models as per orchestrator guidelines. If possible, we might incorporate preliminary testing data or references (for instance, noting that a similar open-source project can handle 100 requests/sec on one machine, so our batch API should be fine). The criterion is met when it’s clear that maintaining 60 Hz is a foremost consideration in the design: the document doesn’t just mention the requirement, it bakes it into design decisions (like sandbox limits, using web workers for plugins, etc.), and a reviewer could say “Given these designs, I’m convinced the system will stay responsive.”

 

Consistency & Schema Compliance: We validate that all terminology, event names, data formats, and UI conventions introduced here are consistent with the rest of WIRTHFORGE. This means checking that if WF‑TECH‑003 defines a message type energy.update, we didn’t accidentally call it energy_update somewhere – any new messages follow the naming style (likely camelCase) and include all required fields. The JSON schemas will be reviewed against existing ones: e.g. the plugin manifest schema should align with any similar concept in WF‑FND‑006 governance (perhaps there was a schema for sandbox policies; we ensure our manifest fields don’t conflict). Terms like “EU (Energy Unit)”, “council mode”, “resonance” etc. that appear in this doc must match definitions from earlier docs (we cross-reference WF‑FND‑002 glossary for those terms). If we introduced a new concept (say “macro” or “workflow script”), we make sure to define it clearly here and consider adding it to the central glossary
GitHub
. We also keep UI/UX consistency: the way we describe user flows here should mesh with the style of prior UX docs (for example, if earlier docs refer to the main window as “Console”, we use the same term rather than inventing new nomenclature). Achieving this criterion means an engineer or writer looking at the entire doc series sees one coherent language and data model. To ensure it, we might do a find-and-compare for key terms and run our example JSON through schema validators including prior schemas. Only when every field and concept lines up (or is intentionally new and documented) do we consider this criterion satisfied.

 

Robustness & Failure Handling: Advanced features introduce new failure modes (a buggy user script, an overwhelming batch job, etc.), so the spec must demonstrate resilience in handling errors and edge cases. We evaluate whether each area has an error strategy: e.g. the plugin sandbox – what happens if a plugin crashes or throws an exception? The spec mentions a recovery: presumably, it isolates that crash and maybe disables the plugin with a notification, which we have touched upon. We also consider multi-step workflows: if step 3 out of 5 fails (maybe the AI model returns an error or times out), do we abort the whole workflow, skip the step, retry? The document should state a policy (perhaps fail gracefully with an error event and allow the rest to continue or not, depending on design). We ensure that the Automation Scheduler has safeguards like not scheduling infinite loops or at least letting the user cancel. We’ve indeed included things like “if limits exceeded, pause or downgrade the plugin”
GitHub
 and logging of errors. In validation, we imagine worst-case scenarios: User writes a plugin that doesn’t stop – do we have a mechanism to halt it? (Yes, sandbox watchdog). A scheduled job tries to generate a million outputs – do we handle that? (Yes, presumably we have memory considerations and might chunk the output). If any plausible failure isn’t addressed, we’ll update the doc to include it. Logging is part of robustness: we confirm the spec indicates that important events and errors are logged or visible to the user (e.g. an “error console” on the dashboard for scripts). Ultimately, this criterion is achieved when the design covers safe operation under adverse conditions – nothing a power user does should crash or corrupt the system without at least a containment plan. The advanced nature of these features means we expect users to push limits, and our design acknowledges and handles that.

 

Documentation Clarity & Format: Finally, we assess that this document itself is well-structured, clear, and follows the expected universal template format from Document DNA through Post-Generation (which it does, as evident by the sections above). We verify that the writing is organized (using headings logically: DNA, Objective, Checklist, etc., as required) and that complex ideas are broken down with bullet points or diagrams as appropriate, rather than dense text. For example, we see that in the Content Architecture, each major section of content is previewed clearly, and later in the asset list, each deliverable is explained in a concise yet informative manner. We would give this spec to a new engineer or designer and see if they can understand how to implement advanced workflows without needing extra explanation. All cross-references are included so they can find further details in other docs (e.g. references to WF‑FND‑005 or WF‑UX‑002 for context). We also ensure consistency in tone and absence of contradictions: earlier sections shouldn’t conflict with later ones (if the Objective says “no cloud”, the rest of the doc consistently reinforces that). If any section was hard to follow or overly technical, we’d revise it for simplicity – perhaps by adding an example or diagram (which we have done liberally). Clarity is also improved by the presence of real-world examples (we included concrete scenarios like “overnight batch job” or “lighting up when models agree”). This criterion is met when stakeholders agree that the doc is not only thorough but also easy to read and use as a blueprint – meaning it could feasibly go to implementation with minimal Q&A needed.

📦 Post-Generation Protocol

Glossary Updates: Upon finalizing this spec, we will update the central glossary (in WF‑FND‑006’s governance docs or a dedicated glossary file) with any new terms introduced here. Terms like “Workflow” (as a saved sequence of tasks), “Macro”, “Expert Mode”, or “Plugin Sandbox” will be added or refined in the glossary to ensure everyone in the team and community uses the same definitions
GitHub
. We’ll also confirm that existing terms like “Energy Unit”, “Council”, or “Resonance” are used here in the exact sense they are defined elsewhere – if we slightly nuanced them, the glossary will note that. This keeps terminology consistent across all documentation.

 

Asset Registration: All deliverables described (diagrams, schemas, code stubs, tests) will be registered in the project’s documentation index and repository. We will create the appropriate directories (e.g. under assets/diagrams/WF-UX-009/, assets/schemas/WF-UX-009/, etc.) and commit placeholder files or links for each item, ensuring traceability. The documentation index (perhaps an internal doc-index.json or wiki sidebar) will be updated to list WF‑UX‑009 and its asset files
GitHub
. Each asset will follow naming conventions and version tagging (e.g. schema files might include a version number or date). By doing this housekeeping, we make sure the outputs of this spec are discoverable and organized for the implementation phase.

 

Prototype Implementation & Feedback: With the specification in hand, the development team will proceed to implement a prototype of the key features. This may involve developing a small subset – for example, creating a basic version of the Workflow Orchestrator and one advanced UI panel – to validate the concepts. As they implement, any discrepancies or unforeseen challenges will be fed back into the document. For instance, if we discover that a certain library is needed for sandboxing that slightly violates “no external dependency,” we would document an exception or alternative. Performance profiling might be done on the prototype (e.g. run a dummy batch of 100 tasks and see if frame rate holds) and those findings could refine our performance notes. Essentially, a feedback loop is established: the document guides the prototype, and the prototype’s learnings refine the document. After this cycle, we’ll update the spec (possibly to v1.1) with any adjustments so that it remains a realistic and validated plan.

 

Team Orientation & Handoff: We will schedule an internal walkthrough of WF‑UX‑009 with all relevant team members – front-end developers, back-end/orchestrator engineers, QA, and UX designers. In this meeting or document handoff, we’ll ensure everyone understands how the advanced workflows are supposed to work and how their domain intersects (e.g. back-end knows about the new API endpoints to support, front-end knows how the UI should behave for Level 4 users, QA knows the acceptance criteria from this doc). Particularly, coordination with the Technical team working on WF‑TECH‑004/008 (plugin system) is crucial: we’ll review our plugin integration approach with them so that the sandbox and extension points match on both sides. Similarly, if any adjustments to the Experience Orchestrator (WF‑FND‑005) are needed (perhaps to handle multi-session or to emit new events like taskQueue.updated), those will be communicated and possibly a minor update to that doc made. The goal is to align all stakeholders so implementation can proceed smoothly without divergent interpretations of the spec.

 

Security & Privacy Review: Although all features are local, we will conduct a focused security review for the new capabilities. This entails going through each advanced feature and assessing potential risks: for example, a malicious actor could try to exploit the scripting feature if they gained access to the user’s machine – we ensure the sandbox can’t be used to escalate privileges. We’ll consult WF‑TECH‑006 (Security) guidelines to check items like injection risks (the API should validate inputs strictly against schemas to avoid any injection even though it's local) and plugin authenticity (maybe recommend checksums or signatures for plugin packages to prevent tampering). Privacy-wise, we reconfirm that no data is sent out; if we added any telemetry for local metrics, we ensure it stays local and is opt-in. If the OWASP Top 10 for LLM or similar local app security checklist is available, we run through it for these features (even though running untrusted code is a user action, we treat the user’s script as potentially harmful and ensure containment). Any findings – say we realize a user script could consume all disk space by writing to a temp file repeatedly – will result in adding a mitigation (like disk usage monitoring or quotas in the sandbox). This step ensures that before implementation is final, we haven’t introduced vulnerabilities or privacy regressions under the guise of power-user functionality.

 

Changelog & Versioning: We will update the WIRTHFORGE documentation changelog to mark the completion of WF‑UX‑009. A brief summary of the advanced features introduced will be written so that others can see what’s new at a glance (e.g. “Added Advanced User Workflows (Level 4–5 features): scripting, custom dashboards, plugin integration...”). The document itself will be versioned as v1.0 upon initial completion. As the implementation progresses, if there are deviations or enhancements, we’ll revise the doc and increment the version (v1.1, etc.), noting changes in an appendix or changelog section in this doc. This way, months later, if someone looks up WF‑UX‑009, they can see if what’s described is exactly what was built or if certain aspects evolved. Maintaining this version history is part of good governance (WF‑FND‑006 principle of measured evolution).

 

Roadmap & Dependency Graph Update: Finally, we reflect these changes in the overall project roadmap. Now that advanced workflows are specified, we can consider them “unblocked” for development. Any items that depended on this (perhaps the user research plan in WF‑UX‑010 assumes these features exist to test with power users, or an enterprise deployment scenario that needed scripting) can now move forward. We will update any high-level architecture diagrams or dependency graphs to mark WF‑UX‑009 as completed in the design phase
GitHub
. This also signals that WIRTHFORGE’s feature set for power users is well-defined, which might influence business decisions (for example, marketing might start preparing materials touting these advanced features for a pro tier). Essentially, this spec’s completion is a significant milestone in the WIRTHFORGE project, and we ensure all planning artifacts acknowledge that – illustrating how it feeds into the final polishing stage (UX-010 user feedback loops) and overall product readiness.

 

By following this post-generation protocol, we ensure that the Advanced User Workflows outlined in WF‑UX‑009 are not only documented but actively integrated into WIRTHFORGE’s development cycle and culture. The result will be a powerful set of user-driven features that enhance the platform for expert users, delivered in a controlled, principled manner consistent with everything WIRTHFORGE stands for. The journey from this document to a working implementation will be tracked and managed so that nothing falls through the cracks and the vision of local-first, energy-aware automation for power users becomes a reality in the WIRTHFORGE experience.
