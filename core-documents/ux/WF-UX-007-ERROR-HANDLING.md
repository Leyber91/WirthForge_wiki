üéØ Core Objective

Deliver a comprehensive local-first error handling and recovery framework that maintains user confidence and keeps the WIRTHFORGE experience smooth even when things go wrong. This document specifies how the system classifies and responds to failures at all levels ‚Äì from AI model hiccups to UI glitches ‚Äì without relying on any cloud services or external support. The goal is to make failure states transparent, understandable, and navigable for the user
GitHub
. When errors occur, the user is quickly informed with clear, actionable feedback, the system attempts automatic recovery when possible, and user progress or data is preserved. In essence, even in worst-case scenarios, WIRTHFORGE should fail gracefully ‚Äì providing fallback visualizations, offline modes, or guided recovery steps ‚Äì so that users never feel stranded or lose trust in the platform. By integrating error handling deeply into both the UX and the technical architecture (orchestrator, AI engine, plugin sandbox), we ensure the platform can self-heal from common issues and guide the user through any manual fixes when necessary. This preserves the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of a responsive, reliable local AI experience and upholds WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs reputation for robustness and transparency.

üìö Knowledge Integration Checklist

Local-First Reliability: All error handling strategies honor the offline-first mandate ‚Äì no cloud-based error reporting or recovery. The system must handle failures internally (logging to local files, local UI notifications) and remain operational without internet access
GitHub
. Any optional external integrations (if present) should fail silently or degrade gracefully so as not to block core functionality.

Error Taxonomy & Policies: Define a clear classification of error types (e.g., user input errors vs. system faults vs. critical failures) and severity levels. Each error class has a policy for handling ‚Äì some can be auto-retried transparently, others require informing the user. These policies align with governance rules so that no error is ignored: even minor issues are logged and can be reviewed later
GitHub
.

Data Integrity & Backup: Ensure mechanisms are in place to protect user data and session state. Critical data (prompt history, energy metrics, plugin state, etc.) should be periodically snapshotted or checksummed so that if a crash occurs, data can be recovered or at least verified for integrity
GitHub
GitHub
. The system should never irreversibly lose or corrupt user data without providing a way to restore it (this might include maintaining a journal of recent actions or an undo log).

Graceful Degradation: Plan fallback behaviors for each major feature in case of partial failures. For example, if the high-fidelity 3D energy visualization fails, switch to a simpler 2D graph; if the local AI model crashes, present a friendly message and pause the session rather than freezing the UI. The UI should reflect error states in subtle but clear ways ‚Äì e.g., dimming certain visuals or showing an ‚Äúenergy disruption‚Äù overlay ‚Äì to indicate something is wrong
GitHub
 without overwhelming the user.

User-Centric Messaging: All user-facing error messages and recovery prompts must be easily understandable, polite in tone, and actionable. Following accessibility best practices, messages are placed consistently (e.g. a dedicated status area) and announced via assistive tech if critical
GitHub
. The language avoids technical jargon and focuses on what the user can do (‚ÄúPlease reconnect to the WirthForge server‚Äù or ‚ÄúRestart the AI engine‚Äù) rather than what went wrong internally. Include contextual help links or info for advanced users who want to dig deeper.

Automation with Oversight: Wherever possible, the system will automatically handle errors (retry connections, restart a plugin, clear a cache). However, these actions should be rate-limited and transparent ‚Äì if the system must retry an action more than N times or disable a feature, the user should be informed and given control. This prevents infinite loops or user confusion from hidden behavior. Every automatic recovery action is logged for traceability
GitHub
.

Testing & Simulation: Define a rigorous testing approach for errors and recovery. This includes automated tests simulating failures (e.g., force a WebSocket drop, corrupt a data file, simulate low-memory) to ensure the system responds as designed. It also includes manual chaos testing where testers deliberately introduce faults (like kill the AI process) to observe recovery. The goal is to validate that for each identified error scenario, the documented recovery plan actually works and the user experience remains acceptable.

üìù Content Architecture

Section 1: Error Classification & Handling ‚Äì This section will introduce the error taxonomy and detail how each class of error is detected and handled in the system. We start by outlining the spectrum of potential issues: from minor UI input errors to critical system failures. For each category, we describe detection mechanisms (e.g., try/catch blocks around AI calls, health checks for services) and immediate handling strategies. For instance, local AI model errors (like the AI process crashing or returning invalid data) will trigger specific UI responses and possibly an automatic model restart
GitHub
. Network connectivity issues (e.g., the WebSocket to the local backend disconnecting) will leverage built-in reconnection logic so brief outages are invisible to the user
GitHub
. We also cover resource exhaustion scenarios ‚Äì what happens if the system runs low on memory or GPU? The policies here might tap into the plugin sandbox‚Äôs resource limits (auto-terminating or restarting a plugin that exceeds its quota to protect overall performance)
GitHub
. Similarly, data corruption events (like a malformed state file or metrics going haywire) will be detected via validation checksums and trigger either a rollback to a last good state or an alert for user to restore from backup. Finally, user input validation is discussed: the UI will prevent or catch invalid inputs (e.g., unsupported prompt commands or configuration values) and guide the user to fix them rather than letting them cause downstream errors. Throughout this section, each error type is cross-referenced with governance policies (for logging) and with UI components that surface the error.

 

Section 2: Recovery Mechanisms ‚Äì This section focuses on how the system recovers from errors, minimizing disruption and preserving user progress. We detail both automatic recovery and manual recovery paths. Automatic retries are covered first: for transient failures (like a lost network packet or a timeout), the orchestrator will quietly retry the action a limited number of times, using exponential backoff where appropriate, to see if the issue resolves on its own. If, for example, the WebSocket disconnects, the client will attempt to reconnect a few times before alerting the user
GitHub
. We then describe component restart strategies ‚Äì how subsystems like the AI engine or a plugin can be rebooted in isolation. The plugin architecture, for instance, allows a crashed plugin‚Äôs sandbox to be seamlessly restarted without restarting the whole app
GitHub
. We‚Äôll provide a sequence diagram of a plugin failure: the plugin host detects the crash, unloads the plugin, and initiates a restart or rollback to a previous version if the new version was the cause
GitHub
. Next, manual recovery procedures are outlined. These are the actions a user might take when automatic methods are exhausted ‚Äì for example, a ‚ÄúReconnect‚Äù button if the UI is offline, or instructions to restart the application or reboot the local AI service. We ensure these procedures are as simple as possible (since the user might already be frustrated by the error). The document also covers data backup and restoration processes: how the system creates backup files of critical data (e.g. user conversation history, settings) and how a user or the system can restore from them in case of corruption or if the user chooses to reset the system. Graceful degradation modes are described with examples ‚Äì if a non-critical subsystem fails (say the fancy energy animation), the system will disable that feature and notify the user that it has been turned off for stability, while keeping core functionality (text interaction, basic visuals) running. Additionally, we include an emergency offline mode scenario: if the orchestrator loses internet (for features that might use it) or cloud-based plugin fails, WIRTHFORGE should detect the situation and continue operating using only local capabilities, possibly warning the user that it‚Äôs in ‚Äúoffline mode‚Äù but still usable. Throughout Section 2, emphasis is placed on preserving user state: after any recovery (automatic or manual), the user should be able to continue where they left off whenever possible (e.g., after a UI reload, the last session state is reloaded so they don‚Äôt lose work).

 

Section 3: User Communication & UX ‚Äì This section details the front-end aspect of error handling: how errors and recoveries are conveyed to the user through the interface. It begins with principles of error message design ‚Äì messages should be concise, friendly, and actionable. We reference the Accessibility document (WF-UX-004) to ensure messages meet readability and tone guidelines (avoiding blame, using clear language). Concrete standards are given: e.g., an error message should briefly describe the issue in non-technical terms and either state the auto-recovery action underway or instruct the user what to do next. The section covers visual and auditory cues for errors: for instance, using a distinct color (like amber or red) for error notifications, an icon (warning triangle), and perhaps a subtle sound or vibration if appropriate ‚Äì all of which should align with the design system. We also discuss placement and consistency: error alerts might appear in a dedicated status bar or dialog area that the user learns to recognize, rather than popping up unpredictably. Importantly, critical errors that stop user progress (e.g., ‚ÄúAI engine not found‚Äù) will be made highly visible (modal dialog or prominent banner), whereas minor notifications (e.g., ‚ÄúReconnecting‚Ä¶‚Äù) might be a small notice in the corner. The document then describes how the UI shows progress during recovery ‚Äì for example, if the system is attempting to fix something (retrying a connection or restoring data), the user should see a spinner or progress bar and a message like ‚ÄúAttempting to reconnect...‚Äù. This keeps the user informed that the system is actively working on the issue, preventing confusion. Next, we integrate help and support: since WIRTHFORGE is local-first and may not have a direct line to cloud support, we include in-app help resources for troubleshooting. This might be a link to a local user manual page or FAQ (e.g., ‚ÄúHaving trouble? See Offline Troubleshooting Guide‚Äù) that users can consult if standard recovery fails. We also mention that error dialogs could include a reference code or detailed info that the user can share with developers (especially for open-source or community support scenarios), without automatically sending data. Lastly, escalation paths for complex issues are covered. If an error is truly unrecoverable (say, repeated model crashes or a corrupted core file), the system will advise the user on next steps ‚Äì this could be as simple as instructing them to update or reinstall, or in a corporate setting, providing a way to export a debug report. The key is that even in worst-case errors, the user is not left in the dark: the application communicates what is wrong (in broad strokes) and what the user can do about it. This open communication is crucial to maintain trust, as users feel the system is transparent about failures and respectful enough to guide them, rather than just crashing or silently degrading.

‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Notes

No Cloud Dependencies: The error handling system operates fully offline, in line with WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs local-first ethos. Recovery processes do not assume any internet connectivity ‚Äì for example, error reports are saved locally rather than sent to a server, and help documents are bundled with the app. This ensures that even without internet, users can recover from issues
GitHub
.

Local Data Integrity is Paramount: We employ safeguards (transaction logs, periodic state saves, checksums) to keep local data consistent. If any data corruption is detected (e.g., a malformed state file or an impossible energy reading), the system will log it and attempt to self-correct (by reverting to last good state or using a backup). Governance policies from WF-FND-006 require integrity checks, so critical data like energy totals or user content might be verified at intervals
GitHub
. Audits will confirm that no user data is lost or corrupted during error events or recoveries
GitHub
.

Energy Visualization Error Indicators: The real-time Energy UI will reflect error states subtly so the user has context. For instance, if the AI stops responding, the energy visuals might freeze or dim and an ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Energy Disruption‚Äù overlay could appear. WF-UX-003 plans include special error state visuals to represent system faults in an intuitive way
GitHub
. These indicators ensure that the user‚Äôs attention is drawn to issues in the same visual language as the rest of the app (instead of, say, generic browser alerts).

Preserve User Progress: Any recovery approach must save the user‚Äôs session and state before taking action. If the UI needs to reload or a plugin restarts, the system should persist the conversation history, user settings, and any in-progress data so that after recovery the user can continue with minimal disruption. Techniques include in-memory state serialization to localStorage or a temp file before a reboot, and restoration after restart. Governance audits will specifically check that features like upgrades or crash recovery did not wipe or alter user data unexpectedly
GitHub
.

Graceful Mode Transitions: When parts of the system fail, WIRTHFORGE will enter a ‚Äúgraceful degradation‚Äù mode rather than simply halting. For example, if a heavy visualization plugin crashes, the system disables that plugin (with notice to the user) and continues in a baseline mode. If network connectivity to a peripheral service is lost, the UI might display an ‚Äúoffline‚Äù badge and hide features requiring that service. The transition into and out of these modes is managed carefully to avoid jarring the user ‚Äì animations might ease the change and messages will clarify that the system is in a limited functionality state rather than completely broken.

Transparent Issue Attribution: The system distinguishes between local errors and external issues, and communicates this to the user. This means if something goes wrong because of the local AI or app (e.g. ‚ÄúThe AI module encountered an error‚Äù), the message will reflect that, whereas if it‚Äôs an optional external integration or user network problem, the app will indicate ‚ÄúThis feature is currently unavailable (no internet connection)‚Äù or similar. Being clear about the source helps users trust that the core system is intact when only an external piece fails, or vice versa. Internally, errors are tagged with their origin (UI, Orchestrator, AI engine, plugin, user action, etc.) so both the system and the user can tell where it occurred. All such events are logged with context for later analysis

## Architecture Diagrams (3 files)

**Error Propagation Flow**: [`assets/diagrams/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-error-flow.md`](../../assets/diagrams/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-error-flow.md)
End-to-end flowchart showing how an error progresses from detection in a subsystem (e.g., AI model failure, plugin crash) to the UI notification and logging. This diagram illustrates decision points like ‚Äúauto-retry or escalate to user?‚Äù and the interplay between orchestrator and UI during an error event.

**Recovery Sequence Timeline**: [`assets/diagrams/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-recovery-sequence.md`](../../assets/diagrams/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-recovery-sequence.md)
A sequence diagram mapping out the timeline of recovery actions for a sample scenario (such as a WebSocket disconnection). It highlights the system‚Äôs automatic actions (retry attempts, state preservation) and where in the timeline the user is brought in (e.g., after 3 failed retries, show error dialog). This helps developers understand the timing and concurrency of recovery logic across components.

**Error Escalation Decision Tree**: [`assets/diagrams/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-escalation-tree.md`](../../assets/diagrams/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-escalation-tree.md)
A decision tree diagram outlining how the system decides the severity of an error and the corresponding response. For example, it branches through questions like ‚ÄúIs the error recoverable without user input? If yes, attempt auto-recovery x3. If no, notify user immediately. If auto-recovery fails, escalate to user with error details and options.‚Äù This diagram doubles as a quick reference for support and QA teams to know the expected behavior for each error category.

## JSON Schemas (3 files)

**Error Classification Schema**: [`assets/schemas/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-error-categories.json`](../../assets/schemas/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-error-categories.json)
A structured schema defining all error types, codes, and severity levels used in WIRTHFORGE. Each error entry includes fields like category (UI, Model, Network, Plugin, etc.), code (unique identifier), severity (info, warning, critical), and userMessageKey (for localization). This schema ensures that all parts of the system refer to errors consistently and can be used to validate that error-producing modules provide the required info (e.g., an error event must include a known code and severity).

**Recovery Plan Schema**: [`assets/schemas/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-recovery-plans.json`](../../assets/schemas/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-recovery-plans.json)
Defines a standardized way to describe recovery strategies for different errors. For each error code or category, this schema outlines the available recovery actions: e.g., ‚ÄúAUTO_RETRY‚Äù: true, ‚ÄúmaxRetries‚Äù: 3, ‚ÄúretryInterval‚Äù: 5000 (ms), ‚ÄúfallbackMode‚Äù: ‚ÄúlimitedUI‚Äù, ‚ÄúuserPrompt‚Äù: ‚ÄúreloadPrompt‚Äù if needed. By formalizing this, we can generate dynamic behavior (the orchestrator could read these plans to decide what to do when an error occurs) and easily update recovery logic without hardcoding every scenario.

**User Message Schema**: [`assets/schemas/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-error-messages.json`](../../assets/schemas/WF-UX-007/WF-UX-007-error-messages.json)
A JSON schema (and example file) listing all user-facing error and status messages in a localization-friendly format. Each message entry might include an id/key (like ‚ÄúERR_MODEL_CRASH‚Äù), a default text (English sentence to display), and maybe placeholders for variables (e.g., {pluginName}) when needed. It also can flag if a message should be announced via screen reader (accessibility flag) or requires user confirmation. This asset ties into both the accessibility aspect (making sure messages are present and well-phrased) and the internationalization strategy for WIRTHFORGE.

## Code Modules (4 files)

**Error Boundary Component**: [`assets/code/WF-UX-007/error-boundary.tsx`](../../assets/code/WF-UX-007/error-boundary.tsx)
A React component that wraps around critical UI sections to catch any rendering/runtime errors on the front-end. This component implements the standard Error Boundary pattern, so if, say, the Energy visualization throws an exception, it will display a fallback UI (perhaps a friendly error graphic and message) instead of a blank screen. The file includes logic to reset the UI state or retry rendering if possible, and hooks to report the error event to the orchestrator for logging.

**Recovery Manager**: [`assets/code/WF-UX-007/recovery-manager.ts`](../../assets/code/WF-UX-007/recovery-manager.ts)
A core TypeScript module in the backend/orchestrator that coordinates error detection and recovery actions. It listens to low-level error events (from the AI engine, plugins, or system monitors) and consults the Recovery Plan definitions. For example, if a plugin crashes, the Recovery Manager is the piece that decides to restart the plugin process and logs the event. It also interfaces with the UI: e.g., sending a WebSocket message to the UI to display an error notification or update the UI mode (to offline/limited) when needed. This module encapsulates the logic for automatic retries, backoff timing, and state preservation triggers (calling the Backup utility before a big recovery action).

**Backup & Restore Utility**: [`assets/code/WF-UX-007/backup-restore.ts`](../../assets/code/WF-UX-007/backup-restore.ts)
A utility library responsible for maintaining backup snapshots of user data and state, and for restoring them. It might interact with WF-TECH-004 (state storage) to take periodic in-memory state dumps or to flush recent user interactions to disk. In a crash scenario, this module is invoked to save state just before a component is restarted (if time permits) and to load the last good state after restart. It can also be triggered manually (e.g., user clicks a ‚ÄúRestore last session‚Äù button after a crash). This code ensures that recovery procedures prioritize data integrity and continuity of user experience.

**Network Watchdog**: [`assets/code/WF-UX-007/network-watchdog.ts`](../../assets/code/WF-UX-007/network-watchdog.ts)
A module focused on monitoring connectivity between the UI and local backend (or any crucial service). It detects heartbeat misses or failures in the WebSocket or API calls and initiates reconnection attempts. The Watchdog integrates with both the Recovery Orchestrator (notifying it of prolonged outages) and the UI (to update the connection status indicator). For instance, if the connection is lost, it might immediately flag the UI to show ‚ÄúReconnecting‚Ä¶‚Äù, and then handle the low-level retry loop. If after several attempts the connection can‚Äôt be restored (perhaps the local server process died), it will signal the Recovery Manager to escalate (e.g., try restarting the server process or prompt the user).

## Test Suites (3 files)

**Error Simulation Tests**: [`assets/tests/WF-UX-007/error-simulation.spec.ts`](../../assets/tests/WF-UX-007/error-simulation.spec.ts)
An automated test suite that deliberately injects or simulates various errors to verify the system‚Äôs response. These tests cover scenarios like: simulate the AI model throwing an exception, drop the WebSocket connection abruptly, feed corrupt data into the state store, or cause a plugin to exceed its resource limit and crash. The expected results ‚Äì such as specific log outputs, the Recovery Manager taking action, or certain UI changes ‚Äì are asserted. This ensures no critical error scenario goes untested during development.

**Recovery Workflow Tests**: [`assets/tests/WF-UX-007/recovery-workflow.spec.ts`](../../assets/tests/WF-UX-007/recovery-workflow.spec.ts)
This suite tests end-to-end recovery processes. For example, it may start a long-running operation, then intentionally kill the AI process to see if the orchestrator restarts it and if the UI resumes streaming afterward. It will validate multi-step flows: e.g., cause a transient error that should auto-retry and succeed on second try ‚Äì the test will check that exactly one retry was attempted and the final result is delivered to the user with minimal delay. Another test might simulate a non-recoverable error and ensure that the user is presented with a helpful error message and that no further background retries happen beyond the intended count.

**UX Validation Tests**: [`assets/tests/WF-UX-007/ux-validation.spec.ts`](../../assets/tests/WF-UX-007/ux-validation.spec.ts)
Focused on the user-facing aspects, these tests (possibly using a headless browser or integration test framework) ensure that error states and messages meet our UX criteria. They check that error notifications are rendered in the correct area of the UI, with correct styling (e.g., warning colors), and that accessibility attributes are in place (like aria-live on critical alerts). They also verify interactive elements in recovery UI flows: for instance, if there is a ‚ÄúTry Again‚Äù button in an error dialog, the test will click it and assert that it indeed triggers a new attempt and eventually clears the error message on success. This suite effectively prevents regressions in the delicate user communication layer of error handling.

## Integration Assets

**Integration Guide**: [`assets/integration/WF-UX-007/integration-guide.md`](../../assets/integration/WF-UX-007/integration-guide.md)

---

**Total Assets Created**: 14 assets (3 diagrams, 3 schemas, 4 code modules, 3 test suites, 1 integration guide) covering all aspects of error handling and recovery. These deliverables ensure that WIRTHFORGE not only anticipates and handles failure scenarios internally, but also provides a transparent and resilient user experience when things go wrong, reinforcing the user's trust in the system's reliability. All error handling logic and messaging adhere to WIRTHFORGE's core principles ‚Äì no silent failures, no lost data, and no mystery to the user ‚Äì thereby turning potential points of frustration into moments where the system proves its robustness and commitment to the user.
