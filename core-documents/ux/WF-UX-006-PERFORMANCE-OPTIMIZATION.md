Executive Summary

WF-UX-006 delivers a unified performance framework and responsive design system that ensures WIRTHFORGE’s user interface remains fast, fluid, and adaptive across all devices. This specification integrates three key deliverables – a real-time Performance Framework, a Responsive Design System, and a Monitoring & Optimization toolkit – into one composite standard. By enforcing a local-first execution model with no cloud or Docker dependencies, the system guarantees that all AI interactions and visualizations occur on-device, preserving user privacy and immediate responsiveness.

 

At its core, the Performance Framework upholds the platform’s energy-truth principle: every visual effect and computation is bound to a 60 Hz update cadence with a strict 16.67ms frame budget. If computation threatens to exceed this budget, the framework invokes graceful degradation and fallback strategies – lowering visual fidelity or skipping non-critical tasks – to maintain smooth interaction. The Responsive Design System builds on this by tailoring the experience to hardware tiers (Low, Mid, High), dynamically adjusting detail levels, resolutions, and effects so that each device operates within its capabilities without compromising the 60 FPS target. Visual elements scale intelligently: on low-tier devices, simpler visuals and reduced effects ensure fluidity, while high-tier “council” scenarios (multi-model orchestration) still hold frame rates by leveraging additional resources.

 

To continually ensure optimal performance, a real-time Monitoring & Optimization module instruments every frame and subsystem. It collects metrics like frame time, CPU/GPU load, memory usage, and battery level, feeding an adaptive control loop. This loop proactively toggles features and quality settings based on current conditions – for example, throttling plugin modules if they consume too many resources, or entering a battery-saver mode when power is low. All metrics remain local (no cloud telemetry), aligning with WIRTHFORGE’s self-measurement and privacy ethos. Developers can leverage these metrics via built-in dashboards and test suites to identify bottlenecks and verify that new features uphold the ≤16.67ms per frame rule.

 

In summary, WF-UX-006 formalizes how WIRTHFORGE achieves console-quality, 60FPS visuals on everyday hardware through local-first engineering, adaptive design, and continuous optimization. It sets the stage for plugin modules and future UI components (e.g. WF-UX-007 UI library) to plug into a robust performance-managed environment, ensuring that no extension or heavy workload can violate the real-time contract or drain device battery. This specification is implementation-ready – complete with architecture diagrams, JSON schemas for performance budgets and metrics, code examples of optimization utilities, and comprehensive test plans – to guide engineers in embedding these principles across the UX layer.

Core Objective

Establish a unified performance optimization and responsive UI framework that guarantees 60Hz real-time rendering on local hardware under all conditions, adapting gracefully to device tiers and battery constraints while forbidding any cloud fallback, so that user experience remains consistently smooth and truthful to the system’s computational energy state.

Knowledge Integration Checklist

Local-First Execution: All UI and AI processing occurs on the user’s device; no cloud offloading or Docker containers are allowed in core flows (no_docker_rule). Performance solutions must run natively and offline-first.

60Hz Frame Budget: Every visual update and computation must fit into a 16.67ms frame budget to maintain 60 FPS. If an operation can’t complete in time, the system must drop, defer, or simplify it (never block the frame loop).

Energy-Truth in UI: Visual elements directly reflect computational load. Heavier computations produce more Energy Units (EU) or visual “strain,” alerting the user when the system is under stress. Conversely, if the system must degrade visuals to keep up, that reduction is visible (not hidden) as part of the experience (e.g. lowering effect complexity indicates conservation of energy).

Graceful Degradation & Fallbacks: Under high load or low power, non-critical features gracefully downgrade (lower resolution, simpler effects, reduced detail) instead of dropping frames. Critical interactions remain responsive. Provide alternative displays for any disabled effects (e.g. static placeholder if an animation is skipped) to preserve UX continuity and accessibility.

Hardware Tier Adaptation: Define clear performance/quality baselines for Low, Mid, High tiers of hardware. On Low-End devices, use simplified processing and minimal visuals; on Mid-Tier, enable standard effects; on High-Tier, unlock full feature set (e.g. multi-model “council” visualization) but still guard frame timing. The app detects hardware capabilities at startup and adjusts settings accordingly.

Battery & Network Awareness: Incorporate battery level and network conditions into responsiveness. Battery-aware rendering dims or simplifies visuals when battery is low to extend runtime (e.g. reduce frame rate to 30 FPS only as last resort, or prefer dark mode to save OLED power). Network usage is minimized and never required for core functionality; any optional cloud sync or downloads throttle to avoid stalling the UI.

Plugin Sandbox Limits: Enforce strict FPS and resource usage limits on plugins. Plugin modules are sandboxed (separate thread or process) and must yield to the main loop. The framework monitors plugin execution time per frame; if a plugin exceeds its budget slice (e.g. >20% of frame time), it gets paused or its effects are downgraded to protect overall FPS. Plugin developers are provided guidelines and APIs to check system “energy” and adapt their functionality (e.g. reduce detail) when the host signals high load.

Monitoring & Telemetry: Continuously collect performance metrics locally (frame times, FPS, memory, CPU/GPU %, battery %) and log significant events (frame overruns, threshold breaches). No personal data or raw content is sent off-device. The system uses these metrics for live tuning and exposes them for developers in debug mode.

Cross-Doc Consistency: Use canonical definitions and units (e.g. frame time in ms, Energy Units from WF-FND-002) for all metrics. Ensure that all strategies here align with governance rules (e.g. any performance-impacting change would be audited via WF-FND-006’s metrics and testing requirements).

Real-Time Performance Framework
Architecture Overview

At the heart of WIRTHFORGE’s performance optimization is a 60Hz Real-Time Loop orchestrated by the DECIPHER engine (Layer 3) and synchronized with the UI (Layer 5). This loop operates on a fixed timestep of 16.67ms per frame, within which all user input processing, AI model computations, and visual updates must occur. WF-UX-006 extends this architecture to ensure the UI layer cooperates tightly with the frame loop: rendering happens in cadence with DECIPHER’s ticks, and any over-budget condition triggers an immediate adjustment in the next frame. The diagram below illustrates the performance-critical components and their interactions in a single frame cycle:

    end
    classDef legendItem fill:#eef,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1;
    classDef legendText fill:#fff,stroke:#fff;


Figure: Performance Architecture – The 60Hz frame loop manages AI processing and rendering. If the orchestrator’s tasks threaten to exceed the 16.67ms budget, the system defers excess work and potentially simplifies the upcoming visual update to maintain frame timing.

 

In this model, Layer 3 (Orchestrator) triggers the cognitive computations (e.g. token generation, energy calculations) and Layer 5 (UI) renders the results each frame. The UI layer is not a passive recipient; it actively monitors time budgets. A lightweight Frame Budget Manager in the UI thread checks the time taken by prior tasks (using high-resolution timers) and decides whether the next frame can proceed with full fidelity or if some content must be skipped or degraded. This collaborative dance ensures non-blocking operation across layers – no layer holds up the others beyond the frame boundary.

 

Crucially, there is no cloud fallback to handle overflow work – if local hardware cannot keep up, the only options are to optimize or degrade. This aligns with WIRTHFORGE’s local-first guarantee: even under stress, all processing stays on-device and the experience adapts rather than offloading to a server. For example, if an AI model inference is too slow, the system might reduce the number of tokens processed per frame or use a smaller model variant, instead of calling out to a cloud API. All such decisions are governed by the performance framework’s policies, which are discussed next.

Frame Budget Enforcement

Every frame, the system enforces a budget of 16.67ms for all work. To achieve this, tasks are categorized by priority:

Critical (must-run): e.g. user input handling, minimal AI token decoding for immediate feedback.

High: e.g. rendering essential UI components and animations.

Medium: e.g. secondary effects or less critical computations (minor enhancements).

Low: e.g. background tasks, logging, non-urgent updates.

The DECIPHER orchestrator schedules tasks with these priorities in mind. If a low or medium priority task threatens to push the frame over time, it is postponed to a later frame. The Frame Loop Controller uses real-time budget monitoring to detect overruns and can even preempt tasks when a threshold is hit. For instance, if by 14ms into the frame most critical tasks are done but some mediums remain, the system knows only ~2.6ms remain; if the remaining tasks would take ~5ms, it will drop or defer some of them rather than exceed the frame.

 

This behavior implements “fail-fast” frame shedding: it’s better to produce a frame with slightly less detail than to produce it late. The principle of adaptive quality scaling under load is applied here. The orchestrator and UI maintain a shared understanding of what can be toggled off. Examples of automatic fallback actions include:

Reducing Visual Effects: e.g. skip a complex particle effect or shader if rendering is behind schedule.

Capping Model Work: e.g. only process a limited number of AI tokens this frame, queue the rest for next frame (ensuring partial progress rather than a stall).

Lowering Update Frequency: e.g. UI might decide to update a secondary panel every second frame instead of every frame if it’s expensive (effectively 30Hz for that component) when under load.

Simplifying Animations: e.g. replace a detailed animation with a simpler one or a static image if needed.

These strategies ensure the 60 FPS cadence never breaks; instead, the content gracefully degrades. The system also logs whenever a degradation occurs, contributing to an “energy usage” telemetry so developers can later analyze how often and where fallbacks trigger.

 

Energy-Truth Adherence: In line with WF-FND-002’s energy metaphor, whenever the system degrades visuals or skips work, it reflects this to the user in some subtle way. For example, an energy bar or particle field UI element (part of the unified visual language) might change color or intensity indicating the system is in a high-load state (low “energy”). This feedback closes the loop, letting advanced users notice when the system is pushing limits, and it keeps with the “what you compute is what you see” ethos. Conversely, when performance headroom is ample, the visuals can ramp back up to full complexity, and the energy indicator shows stable or surplus energy.

Local-First Processing Only

WIRTHFORGE’s core rule of local-core execution means no hidden cloud processing will ever be used to handle performance bottlenecks. The framework does not include any mechanism to offload rendering or computation to cloud servers; all optimization must happen via local techniques. This also implies that the application must be efficient in resource usage: code is written in optimized native languages (e.g. critical loops in C++/Rust or using efficient Python libraries for AI) and avoids heavy middleware that could bloat runtime. In particular, no Docker containers or VMs are used in the core runtime, eliminating the overhead they might introduce. The local process is lean, directly interacting with OS hardware interfaces for graphics and compute.

 

By relying purely on local resources, we embrace constraints that in turn lead to innovative optimizations. For example, the system might use platform-specific optimizations (like Metal/Vulkan for rendering on mobile GPUs) that a generic cloud-based approach couldn’t. It also means the framework must be conscious of thermal and battery impacts of pushing the hardware – topics addressed in the Responsive Design System below. If the device gets too hot or battery drains too fast under constant 60Hz load, the framework’s answer is to modulate the workload (e.g. lower detail or temporarily reduce frame rate), not to offload it. This keeps the user in control and aware of their device’s limits, reinforcing trust that the app won’t “secretly” burn their resources beyond what’s visibly justified.

Diagram – Adaptive Optimization Flow

The following flowchart shows how the performance framework responds to real-time conditions to balance workload and frame budget. It depicts the decision process each frame (or every few frames) to maintain optimal performance:

    subgraph Adaptive Performance Loop
    A1[Start New Frame] --> A2{Previous Frame OK?}
    A2 -- Yes (within 16.67ms) --> B1[Increase or Maintain Quality]
    A2 -- No (over budget) --> C1[Trigger Fallback Actions]
    C1 --> C2{All Critical Tasks Done?}
    C2 -- No --> C3[Drop Non-Critical Task]
    C2 -- Yes --> C4[Reduce Quality Next Frame]
    C4 --> D1[Log Degradation Event]
    B1 --> B2{Spare Capacity > Threshold?}
    B2 -- Yes --> B3[Can We Enhance Quality?]
    B3 -- e.g. Add Effects --> D2[Log Improvement Event]
    B2 -- No --> D3[Steady State (no change)]
    D1 --> E[Next Frame Execution]
    D2 --> E
    D3 --> E
    E --> A1
    end


Figure: Optimization Flow – Each frame, the system evaluates the timing of the last frame and decides to downgrade, upgrade, or maintain visual quality. If a frame missed its deadline, non-critical tasks are dropped and quality is reduced for subsequent frames; if frames are consistently quick, the system can carefully enhance quality until reaching an optimal steady state.

 

In this flow:

The loop first checks if the previous frame stayed within budget. If yes, it checks if there's headroom to possibly increase quality (for example, if recent frames only used 12ms of the 16.67ms budget consistently, perhaps an optional effect can be turned on). This is done cautiously and incrementally, logging any improvement events when quality is increased.

If the previous frame was over budget (missed 16.67ms), the system immediately triggers fallbacks. It ensures all critical tasks did finish (if not, it will drop a non-critical task outright to free time). Then it reduces quality settings for the next frame (such as level of detail, effect complexity). Each such degradation event is logged. The goal is to recover frame timing by the next frame or two at most.

In all cases, the loop proceeds to the next frame with possibly adjusted settings. This creates a feedback control system that keeps the experience as rich as possible while respecting performance constraints.

This adaptive performance controller approach was outlined in the DECIPHER core design and is extended here to visual quality management. By instrumenting both the core and UI, WIRTHFORGE essentially implements a closed-loop optimization: measure frame time -> adjust workload -> repeat, which is reminiscent of a game engine’s approach to maintain frame rate (e.g. dynamic resolution scaling in games). Here, however, adjustments include AI workload as well (e.g. model complexity) and visual effects tied to the AI “energy” concept.

Integration with Orchestration Layer (L3)

Because the orchestrator (Layer 3) ultimately drives the timing (it emits ticks at ~60Hz and processes incoming data), integration between L3 and L5 is critical. WF-UX-006’s framework introduces an interface contract between these layers whereby:

The orchestrator marks certain outputs or events with a cost or priority metadata (for example, tagging a model inference result as high-cost meaning it might be okay to delay its visualization by a few frames if needed). This helps the UI decide what to render immediately vs. defer.

The UI layer can send feedback to the orchestrator if it is consistently overburdened. For instance, if the UI sees multiple consecutive frames over budget due to heavy L3 processing, it can signal L3 to throttle input (e.g. process fewer tokens per second or skip less important calculations). This is done via a control event in the energy.event schema (part of WF-FND-004’s events) such as an "overrunWarning" event carrying current frame metrics. The orchestrator, upon receiving this, could reduce load (perhaps temporarily reducing model sampling rate or complexity).

Both layers share the Energy State Store (from WF-TECH-004) which tracks the current performance mode. The UI can update a field like performanceMode = "degraded" vs "normal" vs "boost" which other parts of the system (or plugins) can read to adjust their behavior accordingly.

This tight integration ensures performance optimization is a system-wide concern rather than just a UI issue. It also paves the way for advanced features like “slow-mo” visualization: if the system ever truly cannot keep up but the task is critical, rather than dropping it, WIRTHFORGE might slow down the overall loop (e.g. run at 30Hz temporarily) but make it obvious to the user by slowing visuals – essentially a last-resort where even that becomes part of the experience (slowing down could be presented as a deliberate effect). However, per our principles, dropping quality is preferred over lowering frame rate, except potentially in extreme battery-saving mode where user explicitly opts for it.

Responsive Design System (Adaptive UX)

While the performance framework ensures the system runs efficiently, the Responsive Design System ensures the UI can adapt its form and function to different device capabilities and contexts without breaking the 60Hz rule. This goes beyond typical responsive web design (resizing layout) – in WIRTHFORGE, responsiveness encompasses hardware tier adaptation, dynamic effect scaling, and energy-aware UI transformations. Key aspects include:

Tier-Specific Baseline Profiles

We define three primary device tiers – Low, Mid, and High – each with a baseline performance and visual profile. Upon startup, the application detects the device’s hardware profile (using known specs like CPU cores, GPU type, RAM, perhaps an internal benchmark run) and assigns one of these tiers (or possibly a continuous scale, but three tiers for simplicity in design and testing).

Low-Tier Devices (e.g. older mobile phones, low-end laptops): The baseline here is simplified visuals and minimal concurrent processing. This tier runs a single AI model at a time (no multi-model council features), uses lower resolution for canvases (e.g. 720p or whatever is native but with downscaled rendering if needed), and disables heavy post-processing effects. Animations are kept basic (no high-FPS particle systems). The goal is to still hit 60fps by doing much less each frame. Example: On low-tier, the background “energy field” visualization might be static or very simple, whereas on higher tiers it’s animated.

Mid-Tier Devices (e.g. average PC, recent smartphone): Baseline is full core features at standard quality. All primary visuals and one or two AI streams can run concurrently. Mid-tier assumes a discrete GPU or decent integrated graphics; it enables standard resolution (1080p) rendering and moderate visual effects (shaders, particles) that have been optimized to not exceed frame budgets. The “energy field” might be animated but with simpler particle counts. All UX Levels 1-5 features are available, but some (like multi-model interference patterns) might run at reduced complexity.

High-Tier Devices (e.g. gaming PC, workstation): Baseline is maximal experience. This tier can utilize multiple models (the “Council” – e.g. 5 models voting – is possible) and high resolutions (1440p or 4K rendering, if supported). Advanced visual effects (real-time glowing energy shaders, complex interference patterns, rich animations) are enabled. However, even high-tier devices must maintain 60Hz; the difference is they can do more within 16ms. The system still monitors and if even a high-tier device is pushed (for example, enabling every possible effect and multi-model at once might still overload), it will degrade just the same. But the thresholds for what to turn on initially are higher. High-tier mode might also allocate more memory for caching to avoid stalls (e.g. caching model outputs, precomputing some visuals).

These profiles are defined in a JSON schema (see Performance Budget Schema below) for consistency. They influence various parameters like the level of detail (LOD) of 3D models (if any), texture resolution, number of particles in effects, maximum number of concurrent AI streams (1 for low, ~2 for mid, ~3-5 for high), etc. The Hardware Tier Adaptations summary from WF-FND-004’s changelog guided these choices, though we refine them with an even stronger stance against cloud/hybrid: note that Hybrid Tier (using optional cloud) is not supported in WF-UX-006’s context – high-tier covers purely local multi-GPU setups; cloud is out of scope (no fallback permitted).

 

All code and design should reference these tier profiles. For example, the CSS or canvas drawing code might check a global app.deviceTier to decide how many layers of shadows to draw. The AI pipeline might load a smaller model on low-tier vs. a larger one on high-tier. This tier-based switch is the first line of defense in responsiveness: start with appropriate complexity for the device to minimize the need for later dynamic scaling.

Dynamic Viewport & Resolution Scaling

In addition to quality scaling, our responsive system handles different screen sizes and resolutions gracefully:

Viewport Flexibility: The UI layout uses fluid design principles to support various screen sizes (from phone screens to large monitors). Important controls are scalable (using relative units or calculated based on screen DPI) so that touch targets remain appropriately sized, and multiple columns or panels can collapse on smaller screens. For instance, the multi-panel layout used in high-tier desktop might collapse to a single column view on mobile, with tabs to switch contexts instead of showing everything at once. This ensures UI remains responsive in layout as well as performance. (Note: This is more traditional responsive design, but we include it for completeness).

Dynamic Resolution Scaling: The rendering engine can adjust the internal rendering resolution to trade off quality vs performance on the fly. On mobile devices or when battery is low, the system might render at, say, 80% of native resolution and then upscale to full screen, to reduce GPU load (a common technique in gaming). This is triggered by either tier or live performance metrics. If the FPS is dropping but most CPU tasks are fine, it implies the GPU might be the bottleneck – the system could then drop resolution slightly to gain frame time. Conversely, if the device is handling it easily, it could increase resolution for sharper visuals. This adaptive resolution is done gradually to avoid jarring changes (and never goes below a floor to avoid blurriness).

Battery-Aware Quality: When the OS signals battery is low or the user enables a “battery saver” mode, the UI automatically reduces brightness of flashy elements, disables non-essential animations, and possibly caps the frame rate to 30Hz if the user prefers extended battery over maximum smoothness. Because we have a strict no-cloud rule, preserving battery is key – especially on mobile, running a 60Hz AI app can be power intensive. The responsive system thus has a Power Save profile that can activate. In this mode, we might lower the frame rate of some background processes (e.g. update energy visuals at 30Hz) while keeping critical interactions at 60Hz, or even globally reduce to 30Hz if absolutely necessary (user opt-in). The user is informed via the UI (an icon or color change) that the app is in power-save mode. This is essentially an extension of graceful degradation aimed at prolonging usability.

Network Conditions: While core operation does not depend on network, if certain features use it (e.g. checking for plugin updates, or optional cloud sync of user data), the responsive philosophy is to never let network slow down the UI. All network calls are done async and results applied on next frame updates. If network is slow or offline, the UI shows an indicator but continues running with whatever data is available. Large downloads (like a new plugin) should be throttled or chunked so that they don’t monopolize I/O and cause frame stutters. Additionally, the design avoids heavy media streaming; any remote content (if ever introduced) would have to be buffered sufficiently. Essentially, network speed does not affect local frame rendering – a core promise of local-first design.

Degradation Strategies and Visual Fallbacks

As part of being responsive and performance-aware, the system includes predefined degradation strategies for various features. This ties into both the performance framework and responsive design. Some notable strategies:

Visual Effect Levels: Many visual elements have multiple quality levels. For example, the energy particle field might have a high-quality mode (lots of particles with glow effects), a medium mode (fewer particles, simpler shapes), and a low mode (perhaps a simple bar or meter). The system can switch between these based on performance and device tier. These modes are defined in the design system so that switching is straightforward at runtime.

Algorithmic Fallbacks: Certain calculations can degrade to simpler versions. For instance, an expensive AI-driven visualization might fall back to a heuristic or static effect if the AI output isn’t ready in time. Or the real-time interference pattern (in multi-model scenarios) might fallback to a simpler overlay if the full computation is too slow on low-tier hardware.

Idle vs Active States: When the user is not actively engaging (e.g. no input for a while), the system can reduce update frequency for some visuals to save power. Conversely, on active input, ensure responsiveness by temporarily prioritizing input handling over background rendering. This dynamic shift provides responsiveness to user actions while optimizing resource use over time.

All degradations are done gracefully: no sudden pop-outs of UI elements. If an element must disappear (e.g. turn off an effect), ideally it fades out or is replaced by a placeholder icon indicating it’s been disabled. The design system includes alternative representations for effects in “low-power” mode. For example, a complex 3D animation might show a small icon (with tooltip “effect disabled to maintain performance”) when turned off. These are part of the accessibility and transparency aspect: the user is kept informed, and any essential info is still conveyed in an alternate form. This way, performance tuning does not compromise core user experience or accessibility (WCAG compliance for contrast, animations off option, etc., are maintained).

 

Finally, the responsive design ensures consistency across UX levels: each progressive UX level (Lightning, Streams, Structure, Fields, Resonance) was designed to add complexity. WF-UX-006 ensures that at lower tiers or high load, the system can temporarily drop down a level of complexity. For instance, if a user has unlocked Level 5 (Resonance with lots of visuals) but is on a low-tier device, the experience might be presented closer to a Level 3 visuals to cope, while still logically being Level 5 in terms of features. This concept of progressive enhancement with graceful degradation is baked into the design of each UX level.

Example: Multi-Model Council on Low vs High Tier

To illustrate responsive adaptation: The Council visualization (multiple AI models running in parallel, showing interference patterns – introduced in WF-UX-002 and WF-UX-003) is very demanding. On a High-Tier PC, WF-UX-006 allows full council mode: e.g. 5 models each rendering a waveform or token stream concurrently, with an overlay showing interference highlights (constructive or destructive interference patterns). On a Low-Tier device, attempting this would surely break 60fps. So, the system falls back to a sequential mode: it might run models one after the other or just show a representative subset. The UI could indicate that due to device limitations, it’s showing a simplified council view (perhaps an icon that says “Simplified for performance” or just less detailed output without the full overlay animation). This way, the user still benefits from the core idea (some sense of model ensemble) but without melting their device. This logic is encoded in the council plugin or feature implementation, guided by the policies of WF-UX-006.

 

This example emphasizes that feature availability is not strictly on/off by device, but rather scaled. High-tier gets the whole show; low-tier gets an approximation, ensuring inclusivity for users on weaker devices albeit with less spectacle. Meanwhile, performance stays within the safe range on both.

Monitoring & Optimization Toolkit

To maintain and continuously improve performance, WF-UX-006 includes a Monitoring & Optimization toolkit. This serves two purposes: (1) Runtime adaptive monitoring, as part of the app’s functionality to auto-tune itself, and (2) Development-time analysis for engineers and testers to measure performance and catch regressions.

Real-Time Metrics Collection

The system collects a variety of performance metrics in real time, all stored and accessible locally. Key metrics include:

Frame Timing: The duration of each frame’s processing (in milliseconds). This can be averaged over a short window (e.g. last 60 frames) to get an FPS reading. The toolkit records not just overall frame time but can break it down by major subsystem (e.g. UI rendering took 5ms, AI inference took 8ms, etc., which it can estimate via instrumentation hooks around those phases).

CPU and GPU Load: Percent utilization of CPU (or specific cores) and GPU if available. This helps identify if the app is CPU-bound or GPU-bound in a scenario.

Memory Usage: Current memory footprint, especially focusing on any graphics memory usage if relevant (for large textures, etc.), to ensure we don’t hit limits that cause slowdowns (like GC or swapping).

Battery Level & Thermal: On battery-powered devices, the current battery percentage and perhaps an OS-reported instantaneous power draw or temperature (if accessible via API). The toolkit watches for battery dropping rapidly, which might indicate heavy usage.

Plugin Resource Usage: If any plugins are active, the system monitors their specific contribution – e.g. how much CPU time a plugin’s thread used this frame, or how much memory it’s occupying. This is important for sandbox enforcement (a plugin exceeding limits can be flagged).

Garbage Collection or Jank events: If using a managed language (like Python or if UI is in web tech), any GC pauses or long jank events are noted.

All these metrics feed into an in-memory Performance Monitor object, which exposes them through a standardized schema. The Metrics Definitions Schema (see JSON below) outlines these metrics fields, their units, and meanings. For example, frameTime.avg, frameTime.p95 (95th percentile frame time), cpu.utilization, battery.level, etc., with definitions for each.

 

At runtime, the system uses these metrics to make decisions (as described in the optimization flow earlier). For instance, if frameTime.avg rises above, say, 18ms (meaning we’re effectively running <55 FPS), that might trigger the degrade path. If battery.level falls below a threshold and battery.drainRate is high, that could trigger power-save mode. These thresholds are defined in the Thresholds Schema (JSON) and can be tuned via config or even learned over time.

In-App Performance Dashboard (Developer Mode)

For debugging and optimization during development (and possibly available as an advanced user feature), WF-UX-006 provides a hidden Performance Dashboard UI. When enabled (via a debug key or command), this overlay shows live graphs of the key metrics (FPS, CPU, etc.), and highlights any threshold crossings or active degradations. It may also list currently active plugins and their resource usage. This is crucial for developers to see how their changes affect performance in real time. It’s also useful for QA to identify if a certain sequence (say, opening a heavy UI panel) consistently triggers a perf drop.

 

The dashboard is implemented in the UI layer but kept lightweight (only updating a few times per second to avoid itself causing overhead). It reads from the Performance Monitor object which aggregates metrics. Because everything is local, this data is high resolution and immediate; there’s no need to send it out. For long-term analysis, the app can dump metrics to a local log file or JSON dump that developers can analyze offline if needed (especially for longer sessions or soak tests).

Logging and Alerting

When performance anomalies occur, the system logs them with context. For example, if a frame took >50ms (an extreme spike), the log might note: “Frame overrun: 52ms, likely cause: Plugin X (used 30ms)”. The monitor can gather stack traces or function timing for such cases if in debug mode. These logs are not shown to end-users but are essential in testing to catch outliers. They also feed into WF-TECH-009’s observability goals of keeping an audit trail of performance.

 

We also implement soft alerts in the UI for the user if something persistent happens, like “Performance degraded due to high load” after, say, 5 seconds of continuous degradation. This can surface as a small text or icon in a corner. The rationale is transparency (the user should know if the app is struggling and doing something about it). It’s akin to how some games show “low framerate” or drop quality automatically and notify the user.

Continuous Optimization Mechanisms

Beyond just monitoring, WF-UX-006 enables the system to optimize itself over time:

Adaptive Thresholds: The system can adjust certain thresholds based on usage patterns. For instance, if it notices that on a particular device, it can actually push to 18ms/frame without the user perceiving issues (perhaps a VRR display or just tolerance), it could adapt the threshold slightly. However, defaults are set conservatively.

User Preferences: Offer advanced users some control, like a toggle for “prefer performance vs prefer quality”. This could bias the system to degrade sooner (if prefer performance) or later (if prefer quality), within safe limits. It’s an explicit setting that influences thresholds in the monitor. By default, WIRTHFORGE aims for balanced, but this gives power users or certain scenarios (like presentations) an option.

Plugin Optimization Interface: Provide an API for plugins where they can register a callback or handler for “onPerformanceModeChange”. This way, if the host app enters degraded mode, the plugin can respond (maybe simplifying its own operation). We also include guidelines that plugin authors should test their modules under simulated low-end conditions and implement at least one level of internal fallback for when they’re asked to throttle. The host can even enforce a reduction by limiting the data rate given to the plugin (for example, if a plugin processes output tokens, the host might feed it fewer tokens per second when under load). This cooperation ensures even third-party components follow the energy economy.

Sample Metrics and Threshold Configuration (JSON)

Below is a simplified JSON schema defining performance metrics and thresholds used by the monitor:

{
  "metrics": {
    "frameTime": {
      "unit": "ms",
      "description": "Frame render time",
      "fields": ["latest", "average", "p95"]
    },
    "cpu": {
      "unit": "%",
      "description": "CPU utilization",
      "fields": ["overall", "perCore"]
    },
    "gpu": {
      "unit": "%",
      "description": "GPU utilization",
      "fields": ["overall"]
    },
    "memory": {
      "unit": "MB",
      "description": "Memory usage",
      "fields": ["rss", "gpuMemory"]
    },
    "battery": {
      "unit": "%",
      "description": "Battery level (0-100)",
      "fields": ["level", "drainRate"]
    },
    "plugin": {
      "unit": "ms",
      "description": "Plugin frame time usage",
      "fields": ["pluginId", "timeThisFrame"]
    }
  },
  "thresholds": {
    "frameTime": {
      "warningMs": 16.7,
      "criticalMs": 20.0
    },
    "battery": {
      "lowLevel": 0.20,
      "criticalLevel": 0.10
    },
    "pluginFrame": {
      "maxBudgetMs": 3.3,
      "action": "throttle" 
    }
  }
}


JSON Schema Excerpt: Metrics Definitions & Thresholds – defines various performance metrics and some example thresholds. E.g., if frameTime.latest exceeds 16.7ms consistently (warning), and 20ms is considered critical, the system will start dropping quality. If battery.level falls below 20%, we might enter power-save (and below 10% maybe more aggressive measures). For plugins, maxBudgetMs: 3.3 means any plugin should use at most 3.3ms of a frame (i.e. 20% of 16.67ms); if it exceeds that, the action is to throttle it (could mean limit its input or reduce its update rate).

 

These values can be tuned per tier (e.g. maybe on a high-tier device you allow plugin up to 5ms if you have GPU headroom, etc.). The schema can be extended to specify per-tier thresholds as well.

Code Hooks for Monitoring & Fallback

To illustrate how the system might implement monitoring and fallback logic, below are sample code snippets (pseudo-code in Python-style for clarity):

 

1. Frame Timer Utility – measures frame durations and checks budget:

# Utility to measure frame time and enforce 16.67ms budget
import time
FRAME_BUDGET = 0.01667  # 16.67 ms in seconds

class FrameTimer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.perf_counter()
        return self
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.duration = time.perf_counter() - self.start
        Monitor.record_frame_time(self.duration)
        # If frame exceeded budget, mark a flag
        if self.duration > FRAME_BUDGET:
            Monitor.flag_overrun(self.duration)


Usage:

with FrameTimer():
    orchestrator.process_cycle()   # do AI and core processing
    ui.render_update()            # do UI update
# After this block, Monitor has the frame time and knows if overrun happened.


2. Performance Monitor Hooks – part of the Monitor class pseudocode:

class Monitor:
    current_metrics = {
        "frameTime": {"latest": 0.0, "average": 0.0},
        "overrunCount": 0,
        # ... other metrics ...
    }
    @classmethod
    def record_frame_time(cls, dt):
        cls.current_metrics["frameTime"]["latest"] = dt * 1000  # ms
        # update running average
        avg = cls.current_metrics["frameTime"]["average"]
        cls.current_metrics["frameTime"]["average"] = 0.9*avg + 0.1*(dt*1000)
    @classmethod
    def flag_overrun(cls, dt):
        cls.current_metrics["overrunCount"] += 1
        cls.current_metrics["frameTime"]["lastOverrun"] = dt * 1000
        cls.check_thresholds()
    @classmethod
    def check_thresholds(cls):
        # Check if any thresholds exceeded and act
        ft = cls.current_metrics["frameTime"]
        if ft["latest"] > Thresholds.frameTime.criticalMs:
            AdaptationManager.reduce_quality(reason="frameTime")
        elif cls.current_metrics["overrunCount"] > 0 and ft["average"] > Thresholds.frameTime.warningMs:
            AdaptationManager.reduce_quality(reason="sustained_frameTime")
        # Similarly check battery, etc.
        batt = cls.current_metrics.get("batteryLevel")
        if batt and batt < Thresholds.battery.lowLevel:
            AdaptationManager.enable_power_save()


This snippet shows how the monitor might automatically call an AdaptationManager to reduce quality when needed. It uses thresholds to decide.

 

3. Fallback Handler – AdaptationManager example:

class AdaptationManager:
    quality_level = 2  # 0=low, 1=medium, 2=high, for example
    @classmethod
    def reduce_quality(cls, reason):
        if cls.quality_level > 0:
            cls.quality_level -= 1
            Log.info(f"Reducing quality to level {cls.quality_level} due to {reason}")
            apply_quality_settings(cls.quality_level)
        else:
            Log.info(f"Already at lowest quality due to {reason}")
    @classmethod
    def enable_power_save(cls):
        if not cls.power_save:
            cls.power_save = True
            Log.warn("Enabling battery saver mode")
            apply_power_save_settings()
    @classmethod
    def restore_quality(cls):
        if cls.quality_level < 2:
            cls.quality_level += 1
            Log.info(f"Increasing quality to level {cls.quality_level}")
            apply_quality_settings(cls.quality_level)


This manager reduces or increases a quality_level which could correspond to presets (like enabling/disabling certain effects). The apply_quality_settings function would toggle detail levels in the app (e.g. set particle_count = 0 if low, or restore if high, etc.). The example also shows toggling power save mode.

 

4. Plugin Throttle Example – inside plugin sandbox:

class PluginSandbox:
    def __init__(self, plugin):
        self.plugin = plugin
        self.time_budget = Thresholds.pluginFrame.maxBudgetMs  # e.g. 3.3ms
    def execute_plugin_frame(self, data):
        start = time.perf_counter()
        try:
            self.plugin.on_frame(data)   # let plugin do its work
        finally:
            elapsed_ms = (time.perf_counter() - start) * 1000
            Monitor.record_plugin_time(self.plugin.id, elapsed_ms)
            if elapsed_ms > self.time_budget:
                self.plugin.set_throttle(True)  # hypothetical API to slow plugin
                Log.warn(f"Throttling plugin {self.plugin.name}, frame usage {elapsed_ms:.2f}ms")


Here we measure how long a plugin’s on_frame took. If it exceeds its budget, we call plugin.set_throttle(True) – this would be an interface where the plugin knows to reduce its own workload (maybe process less data or skip optional steps). If the plugin doesn’t support throttle, the sandbox could alternatively skip calling it on some frames to enforce a lower update rate.

 

5. Frame Benchmark Test Stub – (development test example):

def test_baseline_frame_rate():
    """Benchmark: Ensure baseline app runs at 60 FPS on mid-tier device."""
    app = launch_app(simulated_device="mid-tier")
    app.run_for(seconds=10)
    avg_frame = app.monitor.current_metrics["frameTime"]["average"]
    assert avg_frame < 16.7, f"Average frame time too high: {avg_frame}ms"
    assert app.monitor.current_metrics["overrunCount"] == 0, "Frame overruns occurred on mid-tier baseline"
    app.shutdown()


This pseudo-test launches the app in a simulated mid-tier environment, runs it for a while, then checks that average frame time is within budget and no overruns happened. We would include similar tests for low-tier (allowing maybe occasional degradations but still aiming for <=16.7ms after adaptation).

 

These code snippets illustrate how the principles of the performance framework and responsive design are put into practice programmatically.

Quality Assurance & Testing

To guarantee that the Performance Optimization & Responsiveness specifications are met, we define a comprehensive QA strategy. This includes automated test suites covering performance benchmarks, regression tests for changes, device tier simulations, and plugin impact analysis. Four primary test suites are outlined:

Baseline Performance Benchmarks – This suite tests the application’s frame rate and responsiveness under various known scenarios to ensure the 60Hz target is met. It includes tests like:

Idle Frame Benchmark: Running the system with minimal activity on Low/Mid/High tier simulations and verifying frame time stays well under 16.67ms (headroom).

Full Load Benchmark: Stressing the system with maximum intended workload (e.g. High-tier with council of models, all visuals on) and verifying it still maintains ~60 FPS by activating expected degradations (no runaway frame times). This ensures that even at design limits, the system’s adaptive mechanisms succeed.

Battery Saver Mode Benchmark: Simulate low battery and verify the system automatically enters power-save settings and reduces power consumption (this might involve measuring that frame computations per second or CPU/GPU usage drops accordingly).

Each test in this suite records performance metrics and compares them against the performance budgets defined for that tier. For example, on Low-tier, even at full load, perhaps we expect <50% CPU usage and stable 60fps due to heavy feature reduction. These are validated.

Regression Performance Tests – This suite runs on continuous integration to catch any changes that inadvertently worsen performance. It typically replays a set of recorded usage scenarios (e.g. a script of user actions driving the app through various features) and collects metrics. Key assertions:

Frame time regression: The average and 95th percentile frame times should not increase beyond a small tolerance compared to previous release or benchmark values. If code changes cause even a few more milliseconds on average, the test flags it.

Memory/Resource leaks: Ensure that over a long session, memory usage doesn’t creep up unbounded (which could hint at a leak that eventually hurts performance). Also ensure no growing delays (the adaptive loop should reach steady-state, not continuously degrade).

Consistency of Adaptation: If a scenario historically triggered a quality reduction, it should still do so (or do so earlier if improved). This ensures that adaptation logic remains effective; if a change prevented a fallback from triggering properly, the test would catch that by noticing either dropped frames or no quality change where there should have been one.

Cross-platform checks: If applicable, run on different OS or device configurations to ensure no platform-specific regression (e.g. frame timing precision issues on Windows vs Linux, etc.).

Device Tier Simulation Tests – A suite dedicated to verifying behavior on each tier:

Low-Tier Mode Test: Launch the app in a constrained environment (simulate low CPU/GPU). Verify that on start it correctly identifies as Low-tier and disables/enables features accordingly. Then simulate heavy usage and confirm that frame rate remains ~60 with visual quality being low (checking that certain high-tier features are indeed off or simplified). Also verify that if the device is borderline, the app doesn’t erroneously choose too high a tier – e.g. an automated test might slightly vary the reported specs to ensure the tier decision logic has hysteresis or safe margins.

Mid-Tier Mode Test: Ensure all standard features are on, and that switching from a Low-tier config to a Mid-tier config (or vice versa) triggers loading of appropriate assets (like higher resolution textures for mid-tier) and that performance stays within bounds.

High-Tier Stress Test: Simulate a high-tier device, enable all possible features (worst-case scenario), and verify the system can still handle it by possibly entering degrade modes but not dropping below 60 FPS. For instance, push a council scenario with maximum models; ensure that maybe the system had to downgrade effects, but the outcome is that FPS is maintained. This test might measure that the quality_level (from AdaptationManager) was reduced from 2 -> 1 during the test, which is expected, and that no frame overruns occurred even with full load.

These tests may use profiling hooks to artificially limit performance to simulate tiers if needed (like capping CPU frequency, etc., in a controlled test environment, or using mock objects for Orchestrator that simulate slower computation for low-tier).

Plugin Impact & Battery Tests – Focused on integration points that can affect performance:

Plugin Load Test: Load a test plugin designed to consume significant resources. Measure its effect on frame time and ensure the plugin sandbox throttling kicks in. The test might deliberately make the plugin do something heavy and then assert that Monitor logged a throttle event and that overall FPS did not drop (or only momentarily before throttle). Also verify that the plugin’s functionality scaled down as expected (for instance, if plugin had a quality level API, check that it was invoked).

Battery Drain Test: Simulate battery drain conditions. Possibly use OS hooks or a simulated battery API to feed dropping battery levels to the app. Verify that at 20% battery the app enters power-save (the test can check a flag or UI state indicating power-save mode is on). At critical level (10%), maybe the app dims visuals further or warns the user; ensure those triggers fire. Also measure that in power-save, the CPU/GPU usage actually reduces (meaning the measures taken do reduce load).

Network Latency Test: Though not critical for core operation, if there are any optional network features, simulate high latency or offline mode and ensure the UI remains responsive (no waiting on network on the main thread). For example, if a plugin is being downloaded, the test ensures that the UI’s frame loop still runs 60Hz and that the download happens asynchronously (we might check that frame times remain low while a background thread handles network).

Security/Isolation Test: As an aside, ensure that a misbehaving plugin cannot crash the app or escape the sandbox to directly manipulate the UI in a way that could cause jank. This might involve injecting a plugin that tries to do something forbidden and verifying the sandbox stops it (which indirectly protects performance).

Each test suite will produce a report, and any deviation from the expected performance envelope is treated as a test failure (especially for regression). We also use automated performance profiling as part of CI (for example, run the app for a fixed scenario and output average FPS) to track performance over time, ensuring we meet the success metric of >95% frames within budget.

 

Additionally, as part of QA, we incorporate user feedback loops: if end-users report stutter or heavy battery usage, those cases are turned into new tests or adjustments of thresholds. The governance framework (WF-FND-006) mandates continuous monitoring of such metrics and capacity impacts, so WF-UX-006’s testing feeds into that by guaranteeing we measure and uphold those standards.
