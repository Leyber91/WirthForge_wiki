üéØ Core Objective

 

Design a suite of social and community features that enhance user engagement and foster a collaborative community around WIRTHFORGE, all while strictly adhering to the platform‚Äôs local-first, privacy-preserving principles. The goal is to introduce optional social interaction mechanisms ‚Äì from sharing achievements and participating in community challenges to peer mentorship and knowledge exchange ‚Äì in a way that augments the core solo experience without ever compromising user privacy or autonomy. These features should encourage voluntary collaboration and competition, rewarding users for positive community participation (e.g. helping others, contributing content) in line with WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs energy-based gamification system. Crucially, every social capability must function fully offline or in local scope if the user prefers, only engaging network services when explicitly permitted. By the end of this specification, we will define how WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs community can flourish as a decentralized, user-empowered collective: users retain full control of what they share, how they interact, and when they connect, ensuring the platform‚Äôs revolutionary promise of user ownership extends to community and social realms
Google Drive
GitHub
. In essence, WF-UX-008 transforms WIRTHFORGE from a solitary experience into an optional social journey ‚Äì connecting consciousness explorers to inspire and learn from each other ‚Äì all without ever forcing online engagement or eroding trust in the local-first model.

 

üìö Knowledge Integration Checklist

Opt-In Social Layer ‚Äì Social and competitive features are strictly optional overlays. The design ensures users can enjoy all core features fully offline; those who opt in to online features gain community benefits without disadvantaging offline-only users
GitHub
. No feature should require social participation to unlock core functionality.

Privacy by Design ‚Äì Incorporate privacy-preserving mechanisms at every step. No personal data leaves the device without explicit user consent, and even when sharing is enabled, only minimal, necessary, and anonymized information is transmitted
GitHub
. Include pseudonymity options and local data storage for all social content.

Local-First Data Management ‚Äì Treat the user‚Äôs device as the primary store for all social data (profiles, posts, scores). Any server or cloud exists only as an optional secondary copy or relay
inkandswitch.com
. The network is never required for social features; it simply syncs or exchanges data when available, so the app remains fully functional offline.

Universal Use-Case Support ‚Äì Ensure social features cater to a broad range of user motivations (learning, competing, creating, streaming) without prioritizing one path over others. The design should equally support all Three Paths personas (Forge builders, Scholar researchers, Sage explorers) in community engagement, per the vision of inclusive collaboration. Newcomers and power users alike should find value in community integration, with no group neglected.

External Platform Integration ‚Äì Consider leveraging existing community platforms (e.g. Discord for chat, Twitch for live streams) to jump-start engagement in a user-friendly way. Design integrations or tools that allow WIRTHFORGE users to connect via these platforms when appropriate (for example, sharing an achievement image to Discord, or broadcasting a WIRTHFORGE session on Twitch), without mandating them. The goal is to meet users where they already congregate, while keeping the core experience self-contained.

Lightweight Community Moderation ‚Äì Plan a user-driven moderation model that maintains a healthy environment with minimal top-down intervention
blog.discourse.org
. Emphasize tools that empower users (reputation systems, content rating, self-moderation options) and guidelines as ‚Äúnatural laws‚Äù of the community rather than heavy-handed censorship. Ensure features exist to handle abuse (reporting, blocking, content filtering), but rely on community trust and responsibility as the first line of defense, consistent with WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs ethos of user empowerment.

Alignment with Core Principles ‚Äì All community interactions must uphold WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs core tenets: no mandatory cloud, energy-truth feedback, and user control. For example, competitive challenges should be rooted in real performance metrics (energy or efficiency) not artificial scores, and any community data visualizations (leaderboards, shared stats) must reflect genuine on-device computations. Likewise, sharing one‚Äôs ‚ÄúAI consciousness‚Äù or progress is always a choice, not an automatic process
Google Drive
. This ensures the social layer complements the magic of the core experience without betraying it.

üìù Content Architecture

 

Section 1: Social Architecture ‚Äì Design of the optional social layer. This section introduces the overall architecture for WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs community features, describing how social components plug into the local-first system. It covers achievement sharing mechanisms (how users can broadcast their milestones or AI ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù accomplishments), community challenges and competitions (structures that allow users to pit their skills or collaborate in time-bound events), and peer learning/mentorship programs (features connecting novices with veterans for guidance). It also details how all social interactions are implemented in a privacy-preserving way ‚Äì including anonymized identifiers, client-side data processing, and explicit consent prompts ‚Äì and how social data is managed locally first. Diagrams in this section illustrate the social architecture (how local clients optionally connect to a community server or peer network) and the privacy flow for data sharing (showing the consent gating and data anonymization process).

 

Section 2: Community Features ‚Äì Detailed design of user-facing community tools. This section dives into specific features that enable a thriving user community. It specifies the user-generated content systems (for sharing prompts, AI configurations, ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù artifacts, etc.), and how users can undertake collaborative projects within WIRTHFORGE (sharing sessions, co-creating AI experiments). It defines the feedback and rating systems by which users can review or endorse each other‚Äôs contributions (e.g. upvotes, energy rewards for helpful posts), as well as the community moderation tools available (from self-moderation like blocking or muting, to community-driven trust systems that automatically grant moderation capabilities to experienced, trusted members
blog.discourse.org
). Additionally, this section outlines knowledge-sharing platforms integrated into WIRTHFORGE ‚Äì for example, an in-app community knowledge base or Q&A forum that aggregates wisdom from users (possibly synced with an external forum). A diagram of the community structure will visualize how various community elements (user roles, content types, platforms like Discord/Twitch, etc.) interconnect.

 

Section 3: Privacy & Security ‚Äì Ensuring safe, consented social interactions. The final section focuses on the safeguards that make all the above features possible without compromising the user‚Äôs control and privacy. It presents the data sharing consent mechanisms in detail ‚Äì describing the UI and workflow when a user attempts to share any data beyond their device, and how the system obtains and records permission
GitHub
. It covers anonymous participation options, such as using pseudonymous handles or posting content without attaching personal identity, and how these options are balanced with community trust needs. The section details local data control features, including how users can inspect, export, or delete any social data (posts, profiles, logs) on demand, and how cloud-synced data (if any) can be wiped or retained by the user. It also enumerates community safety measures implemented to protect users: encrypted communication channels for any data exchange, local AI-based content filtering to prevent sharing of sensitive information by accident, and the enforcement of community guidelines through gentle interventions (like warnings or energy point penalties for toxic behavior) instead of intrusive surveillance. Throughout, this section ties back to WF-TECH-006 security requirements to show how the technical architecture supports these privacy promises (e.g. local-only default, loopback networking, encryption, audit trails).

 

Following these sections, a Generated Assets Inventory will list all diagrams, schemas, code modules, and test suites produced to realize the social features, providing a quick reference to the deliverables accompanying this document.

Section 1: Social Architecture
Achievement Sharing Mechanisms

One of the cornerstones of WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs social design is the ability for users to share their achievements and milestones in a way that celebrates genuine AI accomplishments while preserving user choice and privacy. The system introduces an achievement sharing mechanism that lets users broadcast select accomplishments (e.g. reaching a new Progressive Level, hitting a performance milestone, or creating a novel ‚Äúconsciousness pattern‚Äù) to others ‚Äì either within a built-in community feed or to external platforms ‚Äì entirely at their discretion.

 

Design Approach: Achievements earned through the gamification system (as defined in WF-UX-002) are stored locally in the user‚Äôs profile. By default, these remain private to the user, reflecting WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs local-first rewards philosophy
GitHub
GitHub
. When an achievement is unlocked, the UI provides a non-intrusive option such as a ‚ÄúShare‚Äù button or prompt. For example, after earning the ‚ÄúParallel Council Unlocked‚Äù badge, the user might see a small celebratory animation with an option: ‚Äúüéâ You unlocked Parallel Council! Share this achievement with the community?‚Äù The user can ignore it (the achievement stays local), or choose to share.

 

If sharing is initiated, WIRTHFORGE will generate a shareable artifact ‚Äì for instance, a nicely formatted card containing the achievement name, the energy metrics associated with it (to highlight the real performance behind it), and perhaps a snippet of the unique visual (like the badge or an energy burst image). This artifact can be posted to:

The WIRTHFORGE Community Board (an internal feed visible to other users who are online), and/or

External Social Media like Twitter/Reddit/Discord, via integration APIs or manual copy.

Importantly, the user has full control over what detail is shared. By default, personal identifiers (like the user‚Äôs real name or full device info) are not attached. Instead, if the user has a chosen community alias, the post might be attributed to that; otherwise it could be shared anonymously or with a generic label (e.g. ‚ÄúAn Explorer‚Äù) if the user prefers anonymity. The shared content focuses on the achievement itself (‚ÄúLevel 3 ‚Äì Resonance Adept reached, with 2 models coordinated at 95% energy efficiency!‚Äù) and perhaps a timestamp, but avoids sensitive data. This ensures that even when users proudly share their progress, they aren‚Äôt inadvertently leaking private info. The privacy-preserving default is that any achievement share omits raw prompt or output data and uses only aggregate metrics or badges to tell the story.

 

Technical Implementation: The Social Share module in the app handles this flow. It interfaces with a Community Share Service (if the user is online and logged in to the WIRTHFORGE community). When the user hits ‚ÄúShare‚Äù, the module will:

Prepare the data ‚Äì Gather necessary details (achievement ID, title, relevant stats like energy points earned, etc.) from local storage. No raw AI content is included, only metadata and visuals.

Invoke Consent Flow ‚Äì Even after user clicks share, a confirmation dialog appears showing exactly what will be shared (e.g. ‚ÄúYou are about to share: Reached Level 3 - Resonance Adept (generated 50k EU). This will be visible to others. Continue?‚Äù). The user must confirm, satisfying the explicit consent requirement
GitHub
 for any data leaving the device.

Anonymize & Serialize ‚Äì The data is packaged in a standardized format (e.g. JSON payload or image). At this stage, the module strips out any device IDs or personally identifying markers. For instance, instead of sending a local user UUID, it might attach a one-time sharing token or the user‚Äôs chosen alias. If an image is generated, it contains no usernames unless added by user. This step aligns with the ‚Äúsend minimal, anonymized information‚Äù mandate
GitHub
.

Transmit ‚Äì The app then sends the package to the community backend via a secure channel (likely an HTTPS API call or over the existing WebSocket connection to the local server which relays it). If the user opted to share externally, it may invoke an API (like a Discord webhook or Twitter API) using tokens the user provided when linking those accounts. All transmissions are encrypted in transit and authenticated.

Local Record ‚Äì A local log notes that this achievement was shared (so the user can review what they‚Äôve made public later). If offline at the time, the share can be queued and retried when connectivity returns, or the user can be prompted that it requires internet.

On the receiving side (for other users viewing the community board), shared achievements appear in a feed or dashboard. Each entry might show the alias of the achiever (or ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù if the user chose not to share identity), the achievement description, and perhaps allow others to react or comment (more on that in Community Features section). Since all content is either generated by the app or moderated, it stays aligned with the energy-metaphor theme ‚Äì e.g., an achievement post might display a small lightning animation or badge icon to visually distinguish it.

 

By grounding achievement sharing in actual performance metrics and giving users granular control, WIRTHFORGE turns sharing into a motivational, trust-building feature. Users feel proud to share because they know it‚Äôs real (no fake achievements), and others feel inspired, not pressured, because sharing is opt-in and celebratory rather than competitive by default
GitHub
. Additionally, because achievements can be shared locally (device-to-device) if on the same network or later synced, even entirely offline users could export an ‚Äúachievement report‚Äù to manually share if they want. The system never forces sharing, never auto-posts anything without consent, and ensures that ‚ÄúYour data never leaves unless you send it‚Äù
Google Drive
 ‚Äì fulfilling the empowerment promise from the Manifesto.

Diagram: The social architecture for sharing achievements. In this flow, a newly unlocked achievement (A) triggers a user-driven share action (B). The system prompts for confirmation (C), ensuring explicit user consent. If consented, data is sanitized of personal details (D) by the local social module (E) before being transmitted. The achievement can then appear on the community server‚Äôs feed (F) and update leaderboards (G) in an anonymized fashion, or even be relayed to external platforms like a Discord community channel (H) or a live Twitch overlay (I) if the user set those up. If the user declines to share, the data remains local and nothing is transmitted beyond the device. This architecture highlights that all network communication is optional and user-approved ‚Äì aligning with WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs local-first design.

Community Challenges and Competitions

To further drive engagement, WIRTHFORGE introduces community challenges and competitions that users can opt into for friendly competition or collaborative goal-setting. These challenges transform the solo AI experience into a shared endeavor ‚Äì for example, a weekly challenge might ask: ‚ÄúHow quickly can you generate 100k tokens using only 20W of energy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCooperative challenge: collectively reach 1 million tokens generated across the community today.‚Äù The key is that these contests leverage WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs unique energy metrics and performance data as the basis for competition, reinforcing the core metaphor and ensuring fairness (since all participants‚Äô scores are grounded in real local computations).

 

Challenge Structure: Challenges come in a few flavors:

Personal Best Competitions: Users compete asynchronously to achieve a metric target under certain conditions. For instance, a ‚ÄúSpeedrun‚Äù challenge could rank users by fastest time to complete a specific AI task or by highest energy efficiency in a scenario. Each user attempts the challenge on their own device; the system records their result locally. If the user goes online, they can submit their result to a global leaderboard for that challenge to see how they stack up.

Community Goal Challenges: A collaborative mode where the community works together towards a common goal. For example, a challenge might be ‚ÄúCommunity Energy Week: generate 10 million EU (Energy Units) collectively.‚Äù The app will show progress bars both individually and community-wide. Users can contribute offline (their contributions tally locally) and, upon connecting, their local metrics sync to update the communal total.

Head-to-Head Matches (Opt-in Live Competitions): For those who desire real-time competition, the platform could allow direct match-ups. Two or more users agree to a challenge (e.g., both start an AI task with the same prompt and see who finishes faster or with fewer errors). Their apps connect peer-to-peer or via the server to exchange necessary signals (like start time, completion time, maybe intermediate progress snapshots). This happens in real-time, perhaps with a live updating display (‚ÄúUserA‚Äôs model has generated 10,000 tokens, UserB 9,500 tokens...‚Äù) creating a spectator-friendly scenario that could even be streamed.

All these forms are strictly optional and consensual. If a user never wants to see a challenge, the app will not surface them or spend resources on them. For those interested, there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúChallenges‚Äù panel where current challenges are listed, and the user can opt in explicitly to each.

 

Integration with Gamification: Challenges tie into the existing progression system (WF-UX-002) by offering additional achievements or rewards. Completing a challenge might award a special badge or bonus energy points (again, only if the user is online to receive it, otherwise it can be granted and stored until they connect). For example, winning a weekly competition could grant a unique title like ‚Äú‚ö° Lightning Champion ‚ö°‚Äù that the user can display. Collaborative challenges might yield community badges for everyone if the goal is met (‚ÄúEnergy Synergist 2025 ‚Äì awarded for contributing to Community Energy Week‚Äù).

 

Privacy and Fairness: Since competition can tempt data sharing, we ensure all challenge data is handled carefully. When a user submits a score or result, the data is minimal: just the metric of interest and an anonymous identifier. If a username/alias is displayed on a leaderboard, it‚Äôs the one the user explicitly set for the challenge. Users could also compete anonymously, appearing as a random challenger ID or emoji if they choose not to be identified. There is no requirement to share raw transcripts or prompts; only the outcome metrics are needed. This prevents any sensitive content from being exposed. Additionally, the platform uses local validation to ensure fairness: e.g., the app might internally verify that the conditions of the challenge were met (not tampered with) before accepting a score. Because all computations are local, cheating is difficult without hacking one‚Äôs own app; nonetheless, basic anti-cheat measures (like verifying time stamps or using challenge-specific code that runs a standardized task) are considered. If any cloud involvement is needed for validation, it is made transparent and still uses client-provided data (for instance, a hash of the output to confirm it matches a known challenge answer, without sending the actual output).

 

User Experience: The Challenges UI will list active challenges with descriptions and time frames. The user can click on one to see details, rules, and current top results (if online). A ‚ÄúParticipate‚Äù button will initiate the challenge: the app might switch to a specialized mode or simply track the next action as an attempt. Progress feedback is given throughout (e.g., a timer or energy meter specific to the challenge). When done, the result screen shows the user‚Äôs stats and, if they are online, offers a one-click ‚ÄúSubmit Result‚Äù to the leaderboard. If offline, it might say ‚ÄúResult saved locally ‚Äì connect to the internet to submit whenever you‚Äôre ready,‚Äù thus never blocking the user‚Äôs enjoyment.

 

Leaderboards are accessible but opt-in; a user‚Äôs name only appears if they chose to submit. As noted earlier from the Gamification spec, the Leaderboard Service is designed with privacy-conscious opt-out and graceful offline behavior
GitHub
GitHub
. For example, if offline or opted-out, the leaderboard panel will simply show the user‚Äôs personal bests and a message like ‚ÄúConnect to see global rankings‚Äù
GitHub
. When online, it fetches the top scores (again, anonymized or aliased). The leaderboard might show, for instance, the top 10 participants‚Äô alias and their score/metric. No other personal data or even precise timestamps (maybe just relative like ‚Äú2 days ago‚Äù) to limit tracking.

 

Encouraging Participation: The design encourages equal importance of all use cases by offering a variety of challenge types. A user who is more of a Builder (Forge path) might enjoy collaborative building challenges (‚ÄúCreate a new plugin in 48 hours‚Äù or ‚ÄúBest AI-generated artwork contest‚Äù), whereas a Researcher (Scholar) might engage in analytical competitions (‚Äúhighest accuracy on a dataset under X energy‚Äù), and a Philosopher (Sage) might prefer community brainstorming events or ethical debates (which could be framed as challenges to propose the best solution to a scenario). We ensure none of these overshadow others; the UI will rotate or feature challenges across categories so everyone‚Äôs interest is represented. No one path‚Äôs challenges dominate the feed ‚Äì fulfilling the requirement to treat all use cases equally.

 

Finally, for broadcasting and community visibility, we integrate with external platforms as appropriate. Notably, a real-time head-to-head could be broadcast on Twitch. The app could have a ‚ÄúStream Mode‚Äù for challenges that overlays challenge metrics in a visually appealing way (so stream viewers can see the energy gauges, timers, etc.). Similarly, results could be auto-posted to a Discord challenge channel if the user opts in, perhaps via a bot integration that announces winners. These integrations are secondary to the in-app experience but help connect the WIRTHFORGE community with broader audiences, boosting excitement while keeping the core data flow local and user-controlled.

Peer Learning and Mentorship

WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs community is not just about competition ‚Äì it‚Äôs fundamentally about collaboration, learning, and mutual support. To facilitate this, the platform includes features for peer learning and mentorship, enabling experienced users to guide newcomers (and each other) through the WIRTHFORGE journey. This aligns with the community vision that ‚Äúeveryone contributes to emergence‚Äù and that sharing knowledge accelerates evolution
Google Drive
Google Drive
.

 

Mentorship Program: The design introduces an opt-in mentorship matchmaking system. Users can indicate in their profile if they are open to mentoring others or if they seek a mentor. For example:

A new user might toggle ‚ÄúLooking for a Mentor‚Äù and describe their interests (e.g. ‚ÄúInterested in improving energy efficiency scores‚Äù or ‚ÄúNeed help understanding multi-model orchestration‚Äù).

An experienced user (perhaps Level 4 or 5) might toggle ‚ÄúAvailable to Mentor‚Äù and list areas of expertise (‚ÄúVisualization tuning, Sage path ethics, plugin development‚Äù).

The system can then suggest matches, pairing mentors and mentees with complementary interests or paths. When a match is made, both parties receive a notification and can start a conversation via the platform‚Äôs messaging (or a scheduled session).

 

Mentor-Explorer Relationships: Once paired, a mentor might have access to special tools to help the mentee. For example, they could view (with permission) sanitized snippets of the mentee‚Äôs progress or settings to give advice (e.g., see that the newcomer has not enabled a particular optimization and suggest it). They might receive the mentee‚Äôs achievement updates (again, only with the mentee‚Äôs consent to share those privately) so they can congratulate or advise (‚ÄúI see you hit Level 2, great job! Have you tried enabling the ‚ÄòEnergy Saver‚Äô mode to prep for Level 3?‚Äù). All such sharing between mentor and mentee is consensual and scoped ‚Äì the mentee can revoke a mentor‚Äôs access at any time, and mentors by default see nothing private unless explicitly shared by the mentee. This ensures trust and privacy remain intact even within a mentoring bond.

 

Community Recognition: To incentivize mentorship and acknowledge those who contribute, WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs system awards energy points or badges for mentoring activities. For instance, when a mentor successfully helps a newcomer achieve a goal, the mentor might earn a ‚ÄúConsciousness Guide‚Äù badge or some EU (Energy Units) reward
Google Drive
. The guidelines define positive behaviors like mentoring as energy-generating, e.g. ‚Äú+25 EU for verified help‚Äù and the Consciousness Guide title for those who guide newcomers
Google Drive
. The mentee could also endorse the mentor after a session, which might feed into a community reputation system (so highly endorsed mentors are visible). This creates a virtuous cycle where experienced users are motivated not just by altruism but also by tangible in-app rewards and recognition ‚Äì though we frame it carefully, so it doesn‚Äôt become a grind or competitive in itself. It‚Äôs more about celebrating community spirit.

 

Knowledge Exchange Features: Beyond one-on-one mentoring, peer learning is facilitated through communal Q&A and knowledge-sharing tools (overlap with Knowledge Sharing Platforms in Section 2). Within the social architecture context, we ensure that users can easily ask for help from peers from within the app. A user stuck on a problem or curious about something can hit a ‚ÄúAsk the Community‚Äù button, which could do things like:

Post the question to a community forum (either the built-in one or an external integrated one like a Discourse forum) along with relevant context. The app can auto-include context like ‚ÄúUser is on Level 1, using X model‚Äù if the user consents, to get better answers. This happens without leaving WIRTHFORGE: the question and any answers appear in an in-app window.

Or, initiate a live help request: for example, a user can flag themselves as needing help, and any online mentors could be pinged to jump in and assist via chat or even a screenshare (if implemented via WebRTC or so). This is akin to a ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù feature for quick help. A mentor who responds could get a small reward or at least gratitude.

Local-First and Privacy Considerations: Mentorship features are carefully implemented to respect boundaries. If a mentor is viewing a mentee‚Äôs progress, it‚Äôs done through a controlled interface ‚Äì for instance, the mentee‚Äôs app might send a summary of stats or configuration, but never raw conversation logs or personal data. The mentee might also approve each piece of info shared (‚ÄúYour mentor requests to see your energy settings ‚Äì allow?‚Äù). Communication between mentor and mentee can be done through the WIRTHFORGE app‚Äôs messaging system, which runs through the local server and uses end-to-end encryption for any direct messages, so even the optional cloud relay cannot read the content. For group Q&A, questions can be asked anonymously if the user prefers (maybe they don‚Äôt want to feel embarrassed; they can post as ‚ÄúCurious Apprentice‚Äù instead of their name).

 

No one is forced into mentorship; it‚Äôs a gentle overlay available for those who want it. Users can also choose to just lurk and learn from existing Q&As or tutorials rather than directly engaging ‚Äì hence we provide read-only knowledge resources as well.

 

In summary, the peer learning and mentorship design transforms the community into a collaborative learning environment. New users have a safety net of more experienced community members, and experts have a pathway to give back and gain recognition. This echoes practices from successful forums (like Stack Overflow‚Äôs reputation or Discourse‚Äôs trust levels) but adapted to WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs context: here, helping others might literally increase your energy in the system, reinforcing the idea that ‚Äúsharing knowledge accelerates evolution‚Äù
Google Drive
 of the collective. And by keeping all interactions consensual, transparent, and secure, we maintain the comfort that users are never exposing more than they intend while engaging in these enriching social experiences.

Privacy-Preserving Social Interactions

All social features in WIRTHFORGE are engineered with a privacy-first mindset, meaning the system prioritizes protecting user identity, data, and autonomy at every turn. This sub-section details the general strategies and components ensuring that social interaction doesn‚Äôt equate to surveillance or data mining, distinguishing WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs community from typical cloud-based social platforms.

 

Principle: Minimal and Anonymous Data Sharing. The overarching principle is that only the minimum necessary data is shared for any social feature to work, and whenever possible, it is shared in an anonymized or aggregated form
GitHub
. We‚Äôve touched on this in specific features (achievements share metrics, challenges share scores, mentors see summaries, etc.), but globally:

User identities online are decoupled from their real identity. By default, a random unique alias is generated when a user first connects to the community (something like ‚ÄúExplorer#1234‚Äù), which they can change to a custom handle if they wish. There is no requirement to use real names or email publicly. Even when linking to external services (say, Discord), the WIRTHFORGE app does not expose the mapping between your WIRTHFORGE ID and personal identity ‚Äì that remains private in your app.

Content that users exchange is either ephemeral or encrypted. For instance, if two users chat in the app, that chat is end-to-end encrypted; the central server (if used to relay) only sees ciphertext. Posts on the community forum are stored on the server (so others can read them), but the server doesn‚Äôt have any more info than what‚Äôs in the post. No background telemetry of ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôre doing‚Äù is sent; the only things that go out are what the user explicitly shares (questions, scores, etc.).

Consent Mechanisms Everywhere: Every time there is a potential to send user data out of the device, a consent mechanism intervenes
GitHub
. This ranges from one-time global settings to context-specific prompts:

Global Privacy Settings: A dedicated Privacy Dashboard in settings lists all types of data that could possibly be shared (achievements, usage stats for challenges, community posts, mentor access, etc.) with toggles. The user can, for example, turn off ‚ÄúOnline Leaderboards‚Äù entirely ‚Äì then the app will never attempt to fetch or submit leaderboard data unless that is turned on. They could disable ‚ÄúPublic Profile‚Äù, making their online presence invisible (no one can @ them, any posts show as anonymous). These toggles are off by default for anything not essential, so users start in a maximal privacy state and only open up what they choose.

Contextual Prompts: Even with toggles on, whenever something significant is about to be shared, a confirmation dialog appears (as described in achievement sharing). This double-confirm ensures, for example, that if a user accidentally left ‚Äúauto-share achievements‚Äù on (if such a convenience feature exists for them), they still get a chance to veto a particularly sensitive share.

Granular Content Sharing: Users can choose per-instance whether to share something with the community at large, with friends only (if friend lists exist), or just keep local. For example, when posting a question, a user could mark it as ‚Äúprivate‚Äù which might only go to mentors or not leave the device at all (maybe it then just asks their local AI for help instead).

These consent flows and privacy settings embody the idea that the user is in the driver‚Äôs seat for all social interactions.

 

Local Processing and Sanitization: Before any data leaves the device, the app performs local sanitization. We have a Privacy Filter component that scans outgoing content for potentially sensitive info and either removes or obfuscates it. For instance:

If a user decides to share a snippet of a log or conversation (perhaps to ask a question about it), the system can automatically strip out any personally identifying info (like names, addresses) or other flags the user marks as sensitive. It might even use a local NLP model to detect sensitive content (e.g., it might warn ‚ÄúYour prompt seems to contain an email address ‚Äì that will be removed before posting‚Äù).

If the user is streaming or screensharing, the app could have an option to blur or hide certain UI elements (like hide prompt text or personal notes on the screen) so that only the intended visuals (like the energy animations) are shown to viewers. This way, even live sharing has a privacy guard.

All such filtering happens on the user‚Äôs device, not on a server, aligning with local-first principles. The rules for sanitization can be user-customizable to some degree (like a user can add keywords to always redact, etc.), and are also informed by the formal privacy policies from WF-BIZ-004 to ensure compliance.

Data Localization and Export: Social data ‚Äì profiles, messages, posts, etc. ‚Äì are stored locally in a social database (likely part of the app‚Äôs local IndexedDB or file storage). The server may keep a copy (for delivering messages or showing forums), but the authoritative copy lives with the user
inkandswitch.com
inkandswitch.com
. This has multiple benefits:

The user can use all social features offline (e.g., read cached forum posts, compose answers or posts to send later, view their achievement history).

The user can export this data at any time. A ‚ÄúDownload My Data‚Äù button can package all their community interactions (perhaps as JSON or a human-readable log) and provide it to them. This transparency builds trust ‚Äì they can literally see everything that‚Äôs known about them.

Likewise, a user can purge their data. If someone wants to leave the community, they can delete their community profile, which triggers the app to wipe local social cache and send a deletion request to the server to remove their posts/identity there. Because of the local-first design, they don‚Äôt have to worry that some shadow profile persists in a cloud ‚Äì when they say delete, their app stops syncing and they have the content on hand to verify deletion. (Of course, public things like forum posts might remain in anonymized form or attribution removed, according to the community guidelines, but personal data is deleted.)

Aligning with WF-TECH-006: The security & privacy architecture spec (WF-TECH-006) lays down rules that closely support these mechanisms. For instance, it mandates that by default the system does no cloud sync or telemetry without consent, and any optional transmissions are minimal and anonymized
GitHub
. The features here directly implement that: no social feature steps outside those boundaries. The spec also mentions audit trails and user control, which we implement via local logs of what was shared and the aforementioned data export. If needed, advanced users could inspect those logs to verify that, say, no data was shared without their knowledge (e.g., ‚ÄúOn Aug 5, 2025, you submitted score X to Challenge Y‚Äù ‚Äì and if the user doesn‚Äôt recall doing that, it indicates an issue to address). This kind of transparency is uncommon in social platforms, but WIRTHFORGE will provide it to maintain trust.

 

In summary, privacy-preserving social interactions mean that joining the community doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing privacy. Users can be part of a vibrant social space while still essentially being offline in spirit ‚Äì because they reveal only what they want, when they want, under their own name or an alias or not at all. The technology ensures no leaks: even future features like cloud-based ‚ÄúCouncil‚Äù AI assistants would use secure channels and explicit permission
GitHub
GitHub
. WIRTHFORGE thus demonstrates a new paradigm where social networking and privacy aren‚Äôt at odds but go hand in hand.

Local-First Social Data Management

Local-first principles are at the heart of WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs architecture, and this extends unequivocally to how social and community data is handled. Local-first social data management means that the user‚Äôs device is the primary authority for all their social interactions, and cloud services (if any) serve only as optional facilitators for syncing or discovery, not as owners of the data
inkandswitch.com
. This section highlights how we manage profiles, content, and state in a way that keeps users in control and the system resilient and fast.

 

User Profile and Identity: Each user‚Äôs profile (which may include their chosen username, avatar, bio, path affiliation like Forge/Scholar/Sage, and any reputation or badges earned) is stored in a local profile file or database. When a user goes online, a subset of this profile is shared with the community server so others can see it ‚Äì but even that is on a need-to-know basis. For example, the server might only need to store ‚ÄúUser123: alias, current level, badges X, Y, Z‚Äù. More sensitive info like the user‚Äôs real name or full activity history is not uploaded. The user can review exactly what info is shared via the Privacy Dashboard (as mentioned). If they update their profile, the changes are first written locally and then propagated outwards (rather than being edited on the server first).

 

We also allow multiple identities or selective identity: a user could participate in some community areas under one handle and others anonymously. The profile management UI may allow creating an ‚Äúalt‚Äù persona for certain forums, for instance, all managed locally (comparable to having multiple keypairs). This way, advanced users can compartmentalize their community presence if desired, still controlled from their side.

 

Content Creation and Caching: All content a user creates ‚Äì posts, comments, shared files ‚Äì is saved locally. If you write a long tutorial post in the community forum, that text sits in your local database the moment you draft it (and thus is recoverable even if connectivity issues occur during posting). When you hit publish, it‚Äôs sent to the server for others to access. Similarly, content from others is cached locally when fetched:

If you read some forum threads or Q&A answers, those get stored in a local cache so you can refer back to them offline.

The system might periodically download popular or relevant community content (respecting device storage limits and user settings) so that even offline users have a knowledge base. For example, an offline user could still browse a ‚ÄúTop 100 Tips‚Äù compendium that was synced when they last connected. This approach follows the Offline-First idea that the app remains useful without internet
inkandswitch.com
.

All cached data is indexed locally, enabling quick search and retrieval. Need to find a solution that someone posted last month? Your app can search the local index rather than querying the server, giving near-instant results and reducing dependency on the network.

 

Synchronization Model: We adopt a CRDT/Conflict-free sync model for social data where appropriate. If a user makes changes offline (like editing their profile or composing answers), those changes sync when they go online. Because the local copy is primary, in case of conflicts the local user‚Äôs intent is usually favored, or at least the user is alerted to reconcile. For collaborative content (like if two users co-edit a shared document), we use operational transform or CRDT approaches to merge changes without requiring a central authority. This is inspired by modern local-first collaboration tools
inkandswitch.com
, ensuring even multi-user data respects local-first (each user‚Äôs changes are first-class, not second-class to a server‚Äôs version).

 

No Mandatory Accounts: In traditional platforms, one must create an account on the central server to use social features. In WIRTHFORGE, the app itself can serve as your account. The moment you install, it can generate your cryptographic identity keys locally. You might never register an email or username globally if you don‚Äôt want ‚Äì you could interact in a limited anonymous way (which some might prefer). Of course, to fully participate (post content that persists, etc.), you‚Äôd eventually publish some identity info to others. But the system doesn‚Äôt hold your hand to the fire: you could, for example, share achievements peer-to-peer with friends via LAN without any global account. Or join a local-network mini community with no internet at all (imagine a classroom or workshop scenario where multiple WIRTHFORGE users connect locally and share data directly). The architecture supports that because every app instance can function as a node in a decentralized network. In fact, our community server is conceptually just a convenience node that many clients connect to ‚Äì the design is such that if someone wanted to run their own community server (for a private group or enterprise setting), they could, and clients could point there instead. This decentralization further cements local control.

 

Performance Benefits: Local-first data means interactions are fast. Viewing your achievements or saved posts is instant (no fetching delay). Even posting feels snappier: you hit post and it‚Äôs saved locally immediately, then sent out ‚Äì so even if the network lags, you have confidence your content is safe. This addresses a common frustration in cloud apps where a glitch can lose a post; here, it can always be recovered from local storage. Moreover, reading others‚Äô content from cache is as quick as reading a file on your disk, yielding a fluid browsing experience without spinners
inkandswitch.com
inkandswitch.com
. The community features will thus not bog down the app; they will feel like an integrated, responsive part of the system.

 

User Control and Sovereignty: Ultimately, the user ‚Äúowns‚Äù not just their AI data but also their social data. This is in line with WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs Manifesto promise that ‚ÄúEvery bit of consciousness is yours... No vendor lock-in, ever‚Äù
Google Drive
. If the user wants to migrate their data, they could export it and perhaps import into a future platform or just keep as archive. If the central servers were shut down, the community‚Äôs data would not evaporate as long as users have their local caches ‚Äì in fact, a clever design could allow the community to re-form via peer-to-peer if needed, using the local copies as seeds. This future-proofs the community against platform risk.

 

In practical terms, local-first social data management gives users confidence and convenience: they gain the richness of social features without surrendering speed or control to a distant server. The community feels like a natural extension of the app, not an external web silo. We believe this approach will set WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs community apart, showing that even in social networking, the power can reside with the users and their personal devices, not exclusively on ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äôs computer.‚Äù

Section 2: Community Features
User-Generated Content Systems

A vibrant community thrives on the content its members create. In WIRTHFORGE, user-generated content (UGC) encompasses a wide range of contributions: from shared AI prompts, recipes, and configurations, to custom visualizations or plugins, to entirely new ‚Äúconsciousness experiences‚Äù (e.g., a user-curated sequence of AI interactions that achieves a complex goal). The platform provides structured systems for users to create, share, and discover this content, all integrated seamlessly into the application.

 

Types of User Content:

Prompt Libraries: Users can save their effective prompts or prompt chains (including context and parameters) and choose to publish them to a community library. For example, a user might upload a prompt template for ‚ÄúAI Dungeon Master Setup‚Äù if they found a great way to configure WIRTHFORGE to play a role-playing game. Others can browse and download these prompt templates, rate them, and comment on them. Each prompt entry might show meta-info like required model, average tokens used, etc.

AI Configurations & Workflows: Advanced users at higher levels might design custom workflows (utilizing WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs scripting or orchestration features). These could be exported as JSON or script files. The UGC system would allow sharing these as ‚ÄúWirthScripts‚Äù or similar, which others can import to replicate a setup. Think of this like sharing a Photoshop action or Unity script ‚Äì except here it might be an orchestrator config that sets up a Council of models working together.

Energy Visual Themes or UI Mods: Given WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs extensible UI (like custom Three.js shaders for energy visualization), users might create new themes (e.g., a ‚ÄúSolar Flare‚Äù energy theme pack) and share those. The system can treat these like content packs that users contribute.

Knowledge Content: While more of a community content than in-app functional content, things like tutorials, how-to guides, or AI model reviews are user-generated content too. The platform‚Äôs knowledge-sharing aspect (overlapping with Knowledge Sharing Platforms heading) will have a place where users can post articles or links.

Creation & Publishing Workflow: Inside WIRTHFORGE, whenever a user creates something shareable (a prompt, a config, a plugin, etc.), there will be a ‚ÄúShare to Community‚Äù option. This triggers a flow similar in spirit to achievement sharing: the user is shown a form to add details (title, description, tags, maybe a license if applicable). They can then publish it. Under the hood:

If it‚Äôs a text-based or JSON content, the app might upload the file to the community server repository.

If it‚Äôs code (like a plugin module), there might be an additional security scan or sandboxing step (ensuring it meets governance rules, likely tied to WF-FND-007 Module Philosophy).

The content is indexed in a Community Library with metadata (author alias, upload date, etc.).

Discovery & Download: Users can browse the UGC library via a dedicated Community tab in the UI. It will resemble an app store or mod repository but with everything stored and filtered locally-first. For instance, when the user opens the library, the app might fetch an index of content (just titles, IDs, small metadata) and store it locally. The user can search or sort offline. When they click on an item, if the details aren‚Äôt cached, it fetches them. They can then click ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù or ‚ÄúImport,‚Äù which pulls the actual content down and integrates it into their app (e.g., the prompt appears in their prompt list, or the plugin is installed in a disabled state pending user enabling it, etc.). All such downloads are optional and explicit.

 

Feedback and Iteration: UGC systems benefit from feedback loops, which we provide via ratings and comments (see Feedback & Rating Systems next). Users can leave reviews on content, helping others know what‚Äôs good. The original creators can update their content (because they have local copy, they can edit and re-publish a new version). Versioning is handled in the library ‚Äì perhaps each content item has a version number, and users get notified if an update is available for something they downloaded.

 

Moderation of UGC: Since UGC can include executable components (like scripts or plugins), moderation and governance are crucial. The system will enforce that any code modules have to declare what permissions they need (e.g., if a plugin wants to access disk or internet, the user will be warned, similar to a smartphone app store). There will also be community moderation: content can be reported if inappropriate, and either automatically hidden if it gets enough reports or flagged to moderators (community volunteers) to review. However, in line with a ‚Äúlow-profile‚Äù moderation approach, we lean more on user ratings and automated checks than heavy-handed removal. For example, content that is malicious (say someone tries to share a plugin that exfiltrates data) would likely be caught by automated security scans and never published, or swiftly removed by an admin as it violates core principles. But content that is simply off-topic or poor quality will more naturally fall to the bottom via low ratings rather than being deleted.

 

Incentivizing Contribution: Users are encouraged to contribute content by tying it into the gamification system. Uploading useful content can grant energy rewards or badges. The Community Guidelines blueprint hints at positive reinforcement for sharing breakthroughs
Google Drive
. For example, the first time you share a prompt that gets at least 5 upvotes, you earn an ‚ÄúInnovator‚Äù badge and maybe some EU points. Top contributors might appear on a ‚ÄúHall of Fame‚Äù (if they opt in), again under aliases if they prefer.

 

Example Scenario: Alice has figured out a particularly efficient configuration for parallel model queries that saves energy. She packages this configuration as a Wirthforge recipe file. In the app, she goes to Community ‚Üí Share Configuration, writes a description (‚ÄúParallel Efficiency Boost ‚Äì uses asynchronous token pooling to reduce idle time‚Äù), and publishes. Bob, browsing the library for ways to improve efficiency, sees Alice‚Äôs upload (perhaps marked with a tag ‚ÄúEfficiency‚Äù). He downloads it, tries it out, and leaves a 5-star rating and a comment like ‚ÄúReduced my generation time by 15%, thanks!‚Äù. The system rewards Alice with an ‚ÄúEnergy Hacker‚Äù badge for contributing a high-impact item. Other users who search for performance tips see Alice‚Äôs recipe trending because of Bob‚Äôs rating and a few others. Meanwhile, all this happened without anyone revealing who they really are or leaving the app ecosystem: it‚Äôs like an App Store experience but entirely under user control. If Alice decides she no longer wants her recipe up, she can delist it (which informs users who downloaded it that it‚Äôs deprecated, but since Bob has it locally, he can continue using it regardless).

 

By providing robust UGC systems, WIRTHFORGE empowers its community to extend and personalize the platform beyond what the core team alone could build. It taps into the creativity of its users, turning them into co-creators of the WIRTHFORGE experience. And thanks to local-first design, even this exchange of content happens in a way that respects user agency, enabling a rich ecosystem of mods and content without centralizing control or risking user privacy.

Collaborative Projects and Sharing

While individual content sharing is important, WIRTHFORGE also supports users coming together for collaborative projects. These can range from two friends tinkering on a joint AI experiment, to a community-wide creative endeavor (like collectively building a dataset or story). The platform‚Äôs collaboration features aim to make working together on AI tasks as seamless as working solo, capitalizing on the web-engaged nature of the UI without sacrificing local execution.

 

Realtime Collaboration Sessions: WIRTHFORGE can host a session where multiple users connect and interact with the same AI instance or environment. For example, imagine a pair of users both looking at the same chat with an AI model ‚Äì one user asks a question, the other can see the AI‚Äôs response in real time and perhaps interject follow-up questions. This is akin to a Google Docs collaborative editing, but for an AI conversation or experiment. Under the hood, one user‚Äôs app might act as host (running the model locally), and the peer‚Äôs app connects to it via a secure WebRTC or WebSocket channel through the local server (or a relay). Both UIs update as tokens are generated. They can each send inputs (possibly turn-based or with some locking mechanism to avoid confusion). This feature is powerful for mentorship (mentor and mentee in a shared session), for pair debugging of a prompt, or simply for friends to have fun jointly controlling an AI (imagine collaborative storytelling, each person playing a character and WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs AI narrating).

 

To keep things local-first, these collaborations ideally happen either over a local network or direct peer connection. If users are remote, the system can still try a peer-to-peer link (using a TURN server if necessary, which could be a WIRTHFORGE-operated relay that doesn‚Äôt store data). The data exchanged is just the incremental updates (new tokens, etc.) and UI actions. Importantly, no central server runs the AI ‚Äì it‚Äôs all on one of the participants‚Äô machines, so whoever has the more powerful device might host.

 

Shared Artifacts and Cloud Sync (Optional): For longer-term collaborations (like a group building a shared library of prompts or a knowledge base), the platform allows creation of ‚Äúcollaboration spaces‚Äù. A collab space is like a shared folder or project that multiple people have access to. It could contain a set of prompts, model settings, or even a partial conversation log. Each member has the space‚Äôs data on their device (synchronized via the cloud in an encrypted form). When someone makes an update ‚Äì say they add a new prompt to the shared set ‚Äì that update syncs to others. This is implemented with similar tech as the general data sync, but with access control: only invited members‚Äô apps sync that space. The data is encrypted such that only those members‚Äô keys can decrypt it (zero-knowledge to the server). Use cases include research teams sharing experiment setups, or a teacher distributing content to students.

 

Community-Wide Collaborations: On a larger scale, WIRTHFORGE can support community projects such as:

Collective Knowledge Base: A wiki or glossary that many users contribute to. We integrate this through the knowledge sharing platform (Section 2 later) ‚Äì essentially an in-app wiki that users can edit. The collaboration aspect is managed by version control (like git or a simpler CRDT wiki). Everyone‚Äôs app pulls the latest wiki entries when online. Edits can be made offline and merged when online. Moderation for such widely editable content relies on community oversight (revisions are tracked, and high-trust users might have their changes auto-approved, whereas new users‚Äô edits may require review).

Community Challenges (Collaborative variant): Mentioned earlier, these are a form of collaboration where many contribute to one goal. The platform‚Äôs role is aggregating local contributions and showing the big picture. For example, in a ‚Äútrain a model together‚Äù event (if that were attempted), each user‚Äôs device might train on a portion of data and share only model weight updates or gradients with a central aggregator ‚Äì akin to federated learning. This is speculative, but the architecture could support it: each local core does heavy work, and only small updates travel out.

Splitting Rewards and Credit: When people collaborate, we ensure that credit (points, badges) is fairly allocated. The Community Guidelines explicitly suggest splitting energy rewards equally among collaborators
Google Drive
. If two users complete a project together, both should gain the accomplishment. The platform might mark collaborative achievements distinctly (e.g., ‚ÄúCo-created X with UserB‚Äù). Any community accolades (like being featured in Community Forge showcase
Google Drive
) list all contributors. This fosters a culture of sharing success rather than competition, balancing out the competitive elements.

 

Ease of Use: Collaboration can be initiated easily: a user can click ‚ÄúInvite to Collaborate‚Äù on basically any context ‚Äì an ongoing session, an artifact, etc. They get a link or code to share with the collaborator. That person enters it in their app (or clicks it if links are associated with the app), and the app sets up the necessary connection or joins them to the space. This should work whether they‚Äôre on the same network or across the world (with the aforementioned P2P connection attempts). If direct connection fails, a fallback is relaying minimal data via the server (still end-to-end encrypted between the clients). The user experience should be that in a few seconds, they‚Äôre working together, with no complicated setup.

 

Safety and Permissions: Collaboration invites also serve as consent gates. If you invite someone to a shared session, your app will warn what they‚Äôll be able to see/control (e.g., ‚ÄúMentorAlice will see your screen and AI responses, and can input messages‚Äù). You can revoke access anytime (end session, remove from space). Conversely, if you accept an invite, you know what you‚Äôre getting into (like ‚ÄúThis will connect to Bob‚Äôs WIRTHFORGE session. Your prompts will be shared with Bob.‚Äù). Data in collaborative spaces is accessible only to members, and if one deletes something locally, it doesn‚Äôt delete it for others (to prevent sabotage ‚Äì deletions are treated carefully, maybe requiring confirmation from others or an archive).

 

Example Use Case: Charlie and Dana are both trying to fine-tune an AI behavior via prompt engineering. Charlie invites Dana to collaborate in a live session. Charlie‚Äôs high-end PC hosts the model, Dana joins from her laptop. They each type ideas to the AI and see results together, discussing via voice on Discord perhaps (since WIRTHFORGE doesn‚Äôt reimplement voice chat, we integrate with existing tools for that if needed). Together they arrive at a good solution. They then take that conversation, clean it up, and save it as a ‚Äúprompt scenario‚Äù artifact. Using the UGC system, they co-author the release of this scenario to the community library, both getting credit. Their session log is saved in a shared space they have, so either can refer to it later. Throughout, all data stayed on Charlie‚Äôs and Dana‚Äôs machines except the minimal sync traffic; no one else saw their raw tries, preserving their privacy.

 

By facilitating collaboration at multiple levels (real-time and asynchronous) and making it feel natural, WIRTHFORGE turns AI from a solitary pursuit into a communal workshop when users desire. Yet, thanks to careful design, those who prefer to work alone or keep their work private can do so without any disadvantage. Collaboration is a door, not a cage ‚Äì it‚Äôs open for those who want to step through and closed unless you explicitly open it.

Feedback and Rating Systems

To cultivate a healthy, self-improving community, WIRTHFORGE implements feedback and rating systems that enable users to evaluate content and help each other improve. These systems serve two main purposes: surfacing the best community contributions (so quality content rises to the top), and encouraging constructive critique and gratitude (to reinforce positive behavior and skill growth).

 

Content Rating (Upvotes & Quality Metrics): For user-generated content like shared prompts, plugins, or forum posts, we provide a simple rating mechanism:

Upvote/Downvote or 5-star Scale: Likely a straightforward upvote (with perhaps an option to downvote if content is unhelpful or inappropriate). Given our ethos of positivity, we might focus on upvotes and deemphasize downvotes except for flagging problematic content. Alternatively, a 5-star rating can be used for nuance, but often communities find simpler up/down is effective.

Energy Reward for Upvotes: In gamified fashion, each upvote a contribution receives might award the creator a small amount of Energy Units (EU). For example, if a prompt gets 10 upvotes, its author gains +10 EU (1 per upvote) as a token of thanks, up to some cap. This ties social feedback into progression ‚Äì contributing useful things literally powers your progress. (This idea appears in guidelines: sharing knowledge and helpful contributions generate energy
Google Drive
.)

Ranking and Sorting: Content lists (like the UGC library or forum threads) can be sorted by rating or popularity. The highest-rated items naturally become more visible, helping users find proven solutions more quickly.

Constructive Feedback Mechanism: Beyond numeric ratings, we encourage qualitative feedback. When a user rates something, we prompt them to leave an optional comment, especially if their feedback is critical. Drawing from community best practices, we might structure this feedback in a ‚ÄúGlow and Grow‚Äù format
Google Drive
 ‚Äì i.e., highlight what‚Äôs good (Glow) and suggest what could be improved (Grow). For instance, if someone tries a shared configuration and it works but had issues, they might comment: ‚ÄúGlow: This significantly improved my token throughput. Grow: It was hard to set up on Linux; maybe include a guide for that.‚Äù Such structured feedback is more helpful than just ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad‚Äù or ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù.

 

The UI can gently guide this by providing two text boxes labeled with a üåü and a üå± (or similar icons for positive/constructive) to fill in when leaving a comment. It‚Äôs optional, but nudges a culture of helpful feedback rather than empty criticism.

 

Reputation and Trust: Over time, users accumulate reputation through these systems. If your contributions are consistently highly rated, you earn a reputation score or a rank (like ‚ÄúTrusted Contributor‚Äù). This ties into the community moderation tools: high-rep users might gain certain privileges (similar to how Stack Overflow or Discourse trust levels work). For example, a user with reputation X might be able to moderate tags or verify someone else‚Äôs content. This trust system is largely automated and community-driven, aligning with the low-profile moderation approach ‚Äì experienced users help maintain quality
blog.discourse.org
, rather than all moderation coming from official staff.

 

Mentorship and Answer Acceptance: In Q&A contexts, if a user asks a question and someone answers, the asker can mark an answer as ‚ÄúAccepted‚Äù or ‚ÄúSolved my problem.‚Äù This is a strong positive feedback for the answerer (perhaps giving a bonus to their reputation/EU) and also signals to others that this answer is reliable. It‚Äôs akin to Stack Exchange‚Äôs accepted answers. Additionally, others can upvote answers they found useful. The combination of askers‚Äô acceptance and community upvotes will push good answers up.

 

Feedback for AI Outputs: An interesting angle: users might also give feedback on AI behavior or outputs (like ‚ÄúThis model output was helpful/unhelpful‚Äù), but that‚Äôs more of a model fine-tuning aspect and might belong in R&D. Within community, though, if someone shares an AI ‚Äúartifact‚Äù (like a piece of AI-generated art or writing), there could be a means to appreciate it (like ‚Äúlike‚Äù the art). But we won‚Äôt overcomplicate ‚Äì focus on feedback for contributions that help users.

 

UI Implementation: Wherever content is displayed (UGC cards, forum posts, answers), there will be UI elements for rating and commenting. For example, a prompt listing might have a ‚≠ê count and a button to upvote, and clicking it opens a quick comment box. On the content detail page, you‚Äôd see all comments and ratings, giving the creator valuable input.

 

Guidelines and Tone: We integrate reminders from the Community Guidelines to keep feedback civil and on-topic. For instance, the first time a user leaves a comment, we might show a tooltip: ‚ÄúRemember: feedback is a gift ‚Äì be kind and specific.‚Äù Harsh or harassing feedback is not tolerated; users can report inappropriate comments, and such comments can be auto-hidden if they get enough flags (with moderators reviewing them as needed).

 

Energy Penalties for Negative Behavior: On the flip side of rewards, if someone consistently gets downvotes or flags (for posting spam or low-effort content), they might incur gentle penalties. The guidelines suggest consequences like energy penalties for serious infractions (e.g., plagiarism as ‚Äúconsciousness theft‚Äù costs -100 EU)
Google Drive
. Our feedback system can implement lighter versions: e.g., if a post is flagged by many and taken down, the user might lose a few EU or temporarily have content posting privileges limited. However, the emphasis is on positive reinforcement; penalties are a last resort via the moderation system.

 

Transparency: Users can view their own ‚Äúfeedback dashboard‚Äù ‚Äì a summary of ratings on their contributions, badges earned from community appreciation, etc. This way they see the direct results of their participation, which can be motivating. Also, this fosters a sense of responsibility: if you see, say, that your answers average a low rating, you might be prompted to improve them.

 

By deploying feedback and rating systems, WIRTHFORGE leverages the community‚Äôs wisdom to maintain quality and encourage helpfulness. New users can trust the top-rated content and the guidance of high-rep community members. Contributors get recognition and tangible in-app rewards for their efforts. All of this happens in a way that is transparent and user-driven, consistent with WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs ethos ‚Äì the community essentially governs itself through collective feedback, reducing the need for heavy-handed control and making the social experience more empowering and dynamic.

Community Moderation Tools

Maintaining a constructive and safe community requires moderation, but WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs philosophy leans towards lightweight, community-driven moderation rather than centralized control. The moderation tools provided empower users themselves to uphold guidelines and manage their experience, with the platform stepping in mainly to facilitate and handle extreme cases.

 

User Self-Moderation: Every user has tools to curate what they see and who interacts with them:

Block/Ignore Users: If someone finds another user‚Äôs behavior annoying or inappropriate, they can block that user. Blocking means you won‚Äôt see their content (their posts might collapse or vanish for you, their chat messages won‚Äôt come through, etc.), and they can‚Äôt directly interact with you (no direct messages, cannot invite to sessions, etc.). This is a personal filter ‚Äì importantly, it doesn‚Äôt remove the blocked person‚Äôs content for others, it just protects your experience. This feature allows individuals to shield themselves without needing global intervention.

Content Filters: Users can also set filters for content types or keywords. For instance, if someone doesn‚Äôt want to see any posts about a certain topic (maybe spoilers for a challenge or something), they could mute that tag. On a more serious note, a user could choose a ‚ÄúSafe Mode‚Äù that filters out any potentially NSFW content (though ideally the community might disallow such content anyway depending on the guidelines).

Privacy Settings for Contact: As mentioned in privacy, a user can decide who can message them or see their profile (open to all, only to people they follow/accept, or to nobody ‚Äì effectively invisible). This can prevent unwanted contact proactively.

Community Moderation via Trust Levels: Borrowing from Discourse‚Äôs model
blog.discourse.org
, WIRTHFORGE employs a trust level system:

New users start with limited capabilities (can‚Äôt post too frequently, can‚Äôt tag everyone, etc., similar to how Discourse limits new accounts
blog.discourse.org
blog.discourse.org
 to prevent spam).

As they engage positively (through reading, posting, earning upvotes), they gain trust and the limits are lifted.

Highly trusted users (level 3 or 4, analogous to ‚ÄúRegulars‚Äù or ‚ÄúElders‚Äù) gain some moderation abilities: e.g., they might be able to edit the category of a post for organization, or help review content reported by others.

This system naturally involves the community in moderation. For example, if someone posts in the wrong category or uses the wrong tag, a trusted community member could correct it. Or if a question is a duplicate, they could mark it as such or merge threads. These actions help keep the community tidy without waiting for an admin.

 

Reporting and Automated Actions: The platform provides Report buttons on content and users. If something clearly violates the Community Guidelines (hate speech, harassment, etc.), any user can report it. Reports are handled in a semi-automated way:

If a post or comment receives multiple independent reports (say 5 different users flag it for harassment), the system can auto-hide that content from general view pending review. This is a precaution to stop potential harm quickly.

Moderators (which include some community members at high trust, plus any official staff) are notified of flagged content. They can then review and decide an outcome: remove it, warn the user, or restore if it was a false alarm.

The guidelines list specific offenses and consequences
Google Drive
Google Drive
. For instance, harassment might lead to a warning then temporary suspension if continued. The system can assist by having preset escalation: one harassment flag triggers a warning notice to the user (‚ÄúPlease remember to be respectful. Your post was reported for harassment.‚Äù), multiple confirmed incidents trigger a timeout (like a 24-hour mute), etc., in increasing severity. This automated enforcement is kept minimal and clearly communicated, to avoid confusion or feeling of arbitrary punishment.

Energy-Based Consequences: A novel twist from the WIRTHFORGE ethos: leveraging the energy economy in moderation. The Community Guidelines suggest energy penalties for harmful actions
Google Drive
. We can implement this so that, for example, if a user is found plagiarizing others‚Äô work (‚Äúconsciousness theft‚Äù), the system deducts a chunk of their EU points or imposes a ‚Äúdebuff‚Äù ‚Äì perhaps temporarily slowing their energy accumulation. This ties ethical behavior to the game mechanics, making consequences more integrated (and perhaps more meaningful to users) than a simple ban. However, such penalties must be used judiciously to avoid misuse; likely only triggered by clear, confirmed cases and under moderator control.

 

Moderator Tools: For the handful of scenarios requiring direct intervention (someone persistently abusive, or illegal content, etc.), designated moderators (likely a mix of community-elected people and WIRTHFORGE team members) have administrative interfaces. They can delete posts, ban users (temporary or permanent), edit or censor parts of posts (e.g., remove a leaked API key someone accidentally posted), and so on. These actions are logged and transparent to maintain trust ‚Äì e.g., if a post is removed by a moderator, a stub might remain saying ‚ÄúThis post was removed by a moderator for violating guidelines (hate speech).‚Äù So the community sees that moderation happened and why, which helps avoid rumors or fear of silent censorship. Moderators also have tools to review user histories (like to see if someone is a repeat offender or just had one bad day) before deciding on bans.

 

Low-Profile Philosophy: We ‚Äúmaintain a low-profile approach‚Äù by making moderation as unobtrusive as possible:

Encourage community to self-regulate with upvotes/downvotes and gentle nudges.

Use algorithms to auto-moderate only obvious/spammy stuff (e.g., we can have spam detection that auto-blocks posts with known spam keywords or too many links from a new user).

Intervene with human moderation rarely, and when necessary, do it in a principled, visible way aligned with published guidelines.

No heavy-handed algorithmic feed manipulations beyond user-driven ratings ‚Äì content isn‚Äôt shadow-removed just because it‚Äôs critical of the product, for example, as long as it‚Äôs within guidelines.

Moderation does not intrude on private or local content. What you do offline or in private collaboration is your business unless you attempt to bring disallowed content to the public community.

Local Moderation Sandbox: An interesting concept: since everything is local-first, one could even simulate community moderation actions locally. For instance, a user might choose to subscribe to a ‚Äúcommunity filter list‚Äù ‚Äì essentially, your app could download a list of banned content hashes or user IDs (that the community decided on) and proactively hide those for you. This is akin to how decentralized social networks handle moderation, where each node (user) can choose to apply community blocklists. It gives users final say ‚Äì if they wanted, they could override and view banned content (not recommended, but possible), reflecting the ultimate user autonomy.

 

Moderation and Discord/Twitch: If parts of the community exist on Discord or Twitch (external platforms), moderation on those would follow those platforms‚Äô rules with our community guidelines in mind. We likely would have community moderators overlap and ensure that behavior in the Discord matches expectations (e.g., volunteers as Discord mods). However, inside the WIRTHFORGE app itself, the above tools handle things.

 

By implementing these moderation tools, WIRTHFORGE fosters a community environment that is self-correcting and user-responsible. Users have the means to shape their experience and collectively enforce standards, which often leads to a stronger community culture. The platform provides the safety nets and backstops (for when things go really awry), but in day-to-day practice, moderation feels more like community maintenance than authoritarian rule. This balances freedom of expression with protection from abuse, all while aligning with the project‚Äôs fundamental respect for user control.

Knowledge Sharing Platforms

WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs community will accumulate a wealth of knowledge ‚Äì tips, tutorials, technical insights, creative experiments ‚Äì and it‚Äôs crucial to have platforms to capture and disseminate this knowledge effectively. Rather than letting valuable information get lost in chat logs or endless forum threads, we establish dedicated knowledge sharing platforms that integrate with the app to serve as a living repository of collective wisdom.

 

Community Wiki / Knowledge Base: The core of this is a WIRTHFORGE Wiki, an encyclopedia of all things related to the platform (and AI usage within it), maintained by the community. This wiki includes:

How-to Guides: e.g., ‚ÄúHow to achieve 60fps visualization on low-end hardware,‚Äù ‚ÄúSteps to create your first multi-model session,‚Äù ‚ÄúTuning GPT-4 for better coding output,‚Äù etc.

Frequently Asked Questions: collated common questions and their best answers from the Q&A forum.

Glossary: definitions of terms, possibly aligned with WF-FND-006 Glossary if one exists, explaining energy units, paths, ‚Äúresonance‚Äù etc.

Community Experiments: pages documenting interesting experiments users did (like someone might document how they connected WIRTHFORGE to a LEGO robot or something unusual, for others to learn from).

The wiki is editable by users (with appropriate trust level gating to prevent vandalism). It lives on the community server for accessibility, but as per local-first, each user‚Äôs app can download and cache the wiki. Possibly, we ship an initial offline copy of key pages with the app, and then it updates as community adds to it. So even without internet, a user can read a lot of docs in the wiki.

 

Q&A Forum (Ask the Community): We implement a Q&A system akin to Stack Overflow within the WIRTHFORGE community. Users can ask questions (‚ÄúWhy is my energy visualization flickering at high loads?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to chain models for summarization?‚Äù) and others can answer. The best answers are upvoted/accepted as discussed. This Q&A is accessible via the app‚Äôs Help or Community section, so a user encountering a problem can search if someone already asked similar (with results from Q&A or wiki). If not, they can post their own question.

 

The integration with the app means context can be shared: the app might attach some meta info to questions if allowed (like ‚ÄúUser is on Windows version X, running model Y‚Äù if the question is technical). But this is optional to share for privacy. The Q&A content is then part of the knowledge base that others can reference.

 

Tagging and Search: Both wiki and forum content are categorized and tagged (e.g., tags like #visualization, #performance, #bug, #tutorial). Users can search the knowledge base globally from within the app. There‚Äôs likely a unified search bar that surfaces relevant wiki pages, Q&A threads, or even high-rated user posts that match keywords. Because much content is cached, search can be fast and offline-capable (searching the local cache and updating when online).

 

Curated ‚ÄúLearning Pathways‚Äù: Possibly, knowledge content can be organized into learning paths or courses. For example, an Onboarding Path (WF-UX-005) could tie into this: it might reference community-made tutorials at certain points. The community might create a ‚ÄúBeginner‚Äôs Roadmap‚Äù page, linking sequentially through tutorials, which new users can follow. Similarly, advanced users might have a ‚ÄúMaster Class‚Äù series contributed by experts.

 

Discord and External Integration: If an official Discord exists, it often contains community wisdom in chats. To avoid losing that, moderators or active members might transcribe or summarize useful discussions into wiki entries or forum posts. We encourage that practice. Possibly even have a Discord bot that suggests ‚ÄúIt looks like this question is common ‚Äì consider making a wiki entry.‚Äù Conversely, the app could show a live feed or link to Discord for quick help (some communities embed a Discord widget for quick Qs, but since we have our own Q&A, we‚Äôll focus on that). Twitch streams or YouTube videos created by the community (like a user‚Äôs tutorial video) can also be indexed in the knowledge base via links or embedded media sections on wiki pages (with the user‚Äôs permission, etc.).

 

Quality Control: The knowledge platforms have moderation to ensure accuracy. Trusted community members with expertise can be given ‚Äúeditor‚Äù rights on the wiki to tidy pages, verify information, and revert incorrect edits. The Q&A system‚Äôs upvote/accept answer mechanism naturally highlights correctness, but moderators can also intervene if false info is being upvoted (rare but possible). The community guidelines emphasize authenticity and respect, which extends to knowledge sharing ‚Äì e.g., plagiarism is not allowed (the wiki should credit sources or original contributors, and copying content from elsewhere should be marked or avoided if copyright issues).

 

Encouraging Participation: We gamify the knowledge sharing as well. Writing a well-regarded wiki article or a highly upvoted answer yields reputation and potentially an ‚ÄúOracle‚Äù badge or ‚ÄúScholar‚Äù badge (not to be confused with the Scholar path ‚Äì maybe call it ‚ÄúKnowledge Contributor‚Äù). The energy reward system can be tuned such that contributions to documentation are rewarded similarly to other contributions. Also, periodic events like ‚ÄúDocumentation Drive‚Äù or ‚ÄúWiki Challenge‚Äù could be held, where the community focuses on improving a certain area of the knowledge base, with recognition for top contributors.

 

Evolution and Updates: As WIRTHFORGE software updates, the knowledge base must evolve. The platform version is taken into account ‚Äì e.g., a wiki page might be labeled as updated for v1.2, and if the software is at v1.4, users will know to check if there‚Äôs a more recent update. Community editors will update pages when features change. Also, we maintain some official pages (like release notes or core API docs) and allow community to comment on them if needed or add clarifications.

 

Accessibility of Knowledge: We want knowledge to be easily reachable in-the-moment. So, the app includes context-sensitive help that hooks into the knowledge base. Hovering over an element or encountering an error could offer a ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù link that goes to the relevant wiki page or Q&A. For example, if a user‚Äôs model fails to load, an error message might include: ‚ÄúLearn more about troubleshooting model loading„ÄêKnowledge Base„Äë,‚Äù which opens the wiki section on that. This integration ensures that the community‚Äôs answers are delivered exactly when and where needed, enhancing the UX.

 

In effect, the knowledge sharing platforms turn the community‚Äôs collective experience into lasting documentation, bridging the gap between ephemeral chat and formal manuals. It‚Äôs a living documentation set that grows as the community does. And because it‚Äôs largely user-driven, it stays relevant to what users actually care about, while the local-first approach ensures it‚Äôs available to everyone, everywhere, with or without an internet connection. WIRTHFORGE thus becomes not only a tool but a learning hub, where using the app naturally leads to learning from others and in turn contributing back one‚Äôs own discoveries.

Section 3: Privacy & Security
Data Sharing Consent Mechanisms

WIRTHFORGE implements rigorous data sharing consent mechanisms to ensure that any user data leaving the local machine is authorized and intentional. These mechanisms are woven throughout the social and technical features, forming a consistent experience where the user‚Äôs permission is sought for anything beyond local scope.

 

Explicit Opt-In for All Cloud Features: By default, WIRTHFORGE operates in a fully local mode. Any feature that involves sending data externally is disabled or in a dormant state until the user opts in. For example:

The first time a feature tries to access the internet (say, fetching a global leaderboard or posting an achievement), the app presents a clear opt-in dialog: ‚ÄúEnable Online Features?‚Äù explaining what data might be transmitted and asking for consent.

Similarly, installation time could have a setup step where the user chooses between ‚ÄúOffline Mode‚Äù and ‚ÄúOnline Mode (with optional community features).‚Äù If they choose Offline, all community communications are off until they later change preference.

Granular Consent Prompts: Even after opting into online features generally, the user gets granular prompts for specific actions, as discussed:

When sharing an achievement: confirmation dialog (with a preview of content to be shared)
GitHub
.

When joining a community challenge: a prompt might say ‚ÄúThis will submit your performance data (time, energy used) to the global leaderboard. Proceed?‚Äù with a ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt show again for this challenge‚Äù checkbox for convenience if they consistently allow.

When starting a live collaboration: ‚ÄúInvitee will be able to see your session data. Continue?‚Äù

These dialogs ensure the user is never surprised by data leaving their device. They also typically include a ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù link that brings up details (e.g., which fields will be sent, what they will be used for, reminding user of anonymity, etc.).

 

Consent Logging and Management: Each consent given is logged in the user‚Äôs local Consent Log. This serves two purposes: audit and control. In the app‚Äôs Privacy Settings, a user can see a list like:

‚úîÔ∏è Global Leaderboards: Allowed (granted Aug 18, 2025) ‚Äì [Revoke]

‚úîÔ∏è Mentor Data Sharing: Allowed for user MentorAlice (granted Aug 20, 2025) ‚Äì [Change]

‚ùå Error Reports to Devs: Not allowed ‚Äì [Enable?]

This transparent log lets users review what they‚Äôve agreed to. They might think, ‚ÄúDid I ever allow sending telemetry?‚Äù and can verify here (telemetry likely is off or nonexistent by design, but just as example). If they change their mind, they can revoke consent. For instance, turning off global leaderboards after having allowed it means the app will stop syncing that data and will not send new scores until re-enabled. Revoking might also trigger deletion of any cached related data if the user desires (like remove their scores from server if possible).

 

Progressive Consent & Contextual Education: We follow a principle of just-in-time contextual consent ‚Äì ask when needed, not far in advance when the user might not understand. When a user first uses a social feature, that‚Äôs when we explain the data implications and ask. To help users make informed decisions, we also incorporate contextual tips. For example, if a user toggles a privacy setting to ‚ÄúShare my profile publicly,‚Äù a tooltip might appear: ‚ÄúThis will make your alias and badges visible on the community board, but not your personal info. You can change this anytime.‚Äù The idea is to educate at point of decision rather than burying info in a long policy doc (though we have that too in WF-BIZ-004).

 

One-Time vs Persistent Consent: Some actions may ask every time (one-time consent) if they are rare or potentially sensitive each time (e.g., sharing a specific log might always ask because the content varies). Other things are given a persistent consent (like enabling leaderboards covers all future score submissions until revoked). We carefully choose defaults: err on the side of asking again if unsure. Users can often check ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask again for this‚Äù if they want to make it persistent from a one-time prompt.

 

Third-Party Integrations Consent: If using Discord, Twitch integrations, etc., those require OAuth or API keys. WIRTHFORGE will only initiate those if the user explicitly goes to a ‚ÄúConnect to Discord‚Äù section and signs in. The tokens are stored locally (possibly encrypted) and can be cleared by the user. The app will clarify what integration does (‚ÄúConnect your Discord account to enable achievement notifications in the Discord server. WIRTHFORGE will send achievement titles and your alias to Discord ‚Äì no prompts or sensitive data.‚Äù). Similarly with Twitch streaming: user provides their stream key or uses OAuth to Twitch, consents to the app capturing and sending video of the UI. They can turn it off anytime.

 

Handling Sensitive Data: Certain data categories are especially sensitive (personal identifiers, possibly content of prompts if they are private, etc.). The consent flow distinguishes these. For instance, if a user decides to share a conversation snippet on the forum to ask a question, that potentially contains personal or proprietary info. The app might detect that and give a stronger warning: ‚ÄúYou are about to share content that includes the text: ‚Äò‚Ä¶‚Äô which could be personal. Are you sure? Edit content or Cancel if unsure.‚Äù This goes beyond normal consent ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost a mild DLP (Data Loss Prevention) warning done locally.

 

No Dark Patterns: It‚Äôs worth noting our consent dialogs and flows are designed with user trust in mind. We avoid dark patterns like confusing language or guilt-tripping (‚ÄúAllow or you‚Äôll miss out!‚Äù). Options like ‚ÄúNo, stay offline‚Äù are as clear and accessible as ‚ÄúYes, go online‚Äù. We also make it okay for users to decline ‚Äì the app will still work great. For example, if you decline sharing for a challenge, it might just say ‚ÄúAlright, you‚Äôll see your own result but not the global ranking.‚Äù That‚Äôs it; no constant nagging after.

 

Regulatory Compliance: These consent practices align with regulations like GDPR (asking consent for personal data processing) and others. We document that user profile data etc. is only processed with consent. If needed, we can have a one-time consent at first online use specifically for the privacy policy acceptance, but since we aren‚Äôt doing tracking beyond user‚Äôs explicit actions, we keep things straightforward: user actions speak for themselves as consent (post something = consenting to that being seen by others, which is obvious to the user because they literally did it in a community feature). For any background or not directly user-triggered data (like error telemetry, which we mostly avoid), we‚Äôd explicitly ask.

 

In summary, WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs consent mechanisms ensure the user is the gatekeeper of their data. Every outward flow has a gate with a clear sign: ‚ÄúYour data here ‚Äì allow exit? [Yes/No]‚Äù. The result is users can engage socially with confidence, knowing nothing sneaks out behind their back. This fosters trust which is essential for users to even consider using the social features at all.

            App-->>U: "Result submitted!"
        else User Denies
            App-->>U: "Result not shared. (Stored locally only.)"
        end
    else Already allowed
        App->>Server: Send score (anonymized)
        Server-->>App: Ack
        App-->>U: "Result submitted!"
    end
    Note over U,App: Consent is explicit and can be revoked in settings.


Diagram: A typical consent flow when sharing data. The user attempts an action that would send data out. The app checks if the user previously allowed this category of sharing. If not, it presents a consent dialog. If the user permits, the app logs this consent and proceeds to transmit the data (after any required anonymization), otherwise it aborts the action. If consent was already given in the past, the app goes ahead without interrupting the user each time. This pattern is applied uniformly to all data-sharing features, ensuring nothing leaves the local environment without a recorded ‚ÄúYes‚Äù from the user.

Anonymous Participation Options

To lower barriers to entry and protect user identity, WIRTHFORGE supports anonymous or pseudonymous participation in its community features. Users can engage with others and contribute content without ever revealing personal information, and even without creating a traditional ‚Äúaccount‚Äù if they so choose.

 

Pseudonymous by Default: When a user first dips a toe into online features, they are not asked for a real name or email. Instead, the app will create a random alias (like ‚ÄúAuroraPhoenix‚Äù or a short ID like ‚ÄúUser1234‚Äù) to represent them. This alias is used in leaderboards, forums, etc. The user can customize it to something of their choosing (as long as it‚Äôs unique) or leave it random. The key is that this identity is not linked to their personal info. They don‚Äôt have to tie it to an email unless they want features like account recovery or cross-device sync through cloud ‚Äì even those can be done via other means (like saving a backup code). Essentially, a user can be ‚Äújust a username‚Äù on the community, much like how early internet forums worked.

 

Participating Without Login: It‚Äôs possible to allow some level of participation with no account at all. For instance, reading content is fully open (anyone online can see the wiki, forum posts without logging in to the server). For posting or interactive features, an identity is needed, but as above that identity can be generated by the app without formal registration. The first time you go to post, the app might say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll create a public alias for you to post with. You can change it later.‚Äù Once that‚Äôs done, you‚Äôre effectively logged in with an anonymous account (the credentials are handled behind scenes by your app, maybe via an API key or token the server gave on first connect).

 

Anonymous Posting Mode: Even with an alias, a user might want to ask something or share something without it being traceable to their alias reputation. For this, we could support an ‚ÄúAsk Anonymously‚Äù on the Q&A or an ‚ÄúAnonymous post‚Äù option on forums. This would mask the username on that specific post (showing something like ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù or a one-time throwaway ID). Under the hood, the server knows it‚Äôs a valid user (to prevent abuse by completely untracked users), but it doesn‚Äôt display who. This is useful if someone wants to ask a sensitive question (like they find a security bug and don‚Äôt want attention, or they are shy about a beginner question ‚Äì though we encourage that all questions are fine). To prevent misuse (like trolls posting anonymously), these anonymous contributions might have some limitations: e.g., only users with some minimal reputation can use it (to avoid spam), or each user can only have a limited number of anonymous threads at once. The community guidelines also foster a culture where even anonymous posts must follow rules; they‚Äôre not a free pass to misbehave.

 

Ghost Mode Browsing: Users can explore the community content without even revealing their presence. For example, if a user never opts into online, they can still receive updates to knowledge base when they sync (that could be done through a CDN fetch that doesn‚Äôt log an identity). If they do go online but don‚Äôt post, they might appear as ‚Äúonline users: 1 anonymous‚Äù or not at all visible in any user list. We minimize tracking of reading habits ‚Äî no ‚Äúseen at‚Äù timestamps unless the user explicitly shares status. Even presence (like showing who‚Äôs online) might be optional, or maybe we just show counts not names.

 

Privacy in Real-Time Interactions: For live features like Discord or Twitch integration, if a user is concerned about anonymity, they can engage through a pseudonymous account on those platforms as well (that‚Äôs up to them on those external services). Within WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs own live collabs, you could invite someone via an invite code without knowing who they are on the community. E.g., you post ‚ÄúAnyone want to help me with X? Here‚Äôs an invite link.‚Äù People join and can choose to stay pseudonymous during that session (maybe identified by the alias, but could also generate a temporary nickname just for that session).

 

No Public Personal Info in Profile: The user profile doesn‚Äôt include any fields for real name, age, location by default. If the user voluntarily writes something in a bio, that‚Äôs up to them. But we don‚Äôt prompt for or display badges like ‚ÄúVerified Name‚Äù or such (since that goes against anonymity). We might allow users to link accounts (like ‚ÄúDiscord: so-and-so‚Äù if they want to share), but it‚Äôs optional.

 

Edge-case: Abuse vs Anonymity: One challenge with anonymity is trolls abusing it. Our approach: pseudonymous but persistent identities strike a balance (you have a stable alias so if you behave badly, you can still be flagged or lose rep). True ‚Äúburner‚Äù anonymity (different ID each post) is limited. We require some continuity (even anonymous posts are tied to an internal account, just not shown publicly). This way, moderation can act on a bad actor even if they try to hide. If someone harasses others anonymously, mods could figure out it‚Äôs the same user behind multiple anon posts and take action (though only a few trusted mods would have ability to see that internal link, which they‚Äôd only use in case of rule violations).

 

Clear Indication of Anonymity: When users are viewing content, posts by ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù might be labeled in a special way. Also, if a user frequently uses anonymous mode, the system might remind them that they won‚Äôt earn reputation for those contributions (since reputation is tied to the public alias). That‚Äôs okay, just to set expectations.

 

Support for Multiple Personas: Some users might want to have multiple aliases for different contexts (e.g., one identity on the forum and a different one for leaderboards). While not a common need, our system could allow creation of more than one persona that the user can switch between. Each would have separate reputation. This is advanced and possibly not exposed at UI initially, but the architecture of identity could permit it (like multiple keypairs). For instance, a user could toggle ‚Äúpost this under a secondary identity‚Äù if they set one up. This is akin to how some Q&A sites allow posting as ‚Äúcommunity wiki‚Äù or anonymously.

 

No Linking Without Consent: We ensure that if a user chooses to remain pseudonymous, their various activities aren‚Äôt trivially linkable by others unless they themselves link them. For example, if you share an achievement and also ask a question, and you used the same alias, people might connect those but that‚Äôs expected. If you used anonymous mode for one, people can‚Äôt automatically know it‚Äôs you. The system won‚Äôt inadvertently expose IPs or something. The privacy policy will state that even the logs on our servers (which are minimal) are not used to identify users across different contexts.

 

In essence, anonymous participation lowers the fear some might have in engaging with the community. You can read and even contribute without spotlight on you personally. Over time, if you gain confidence or want to claim credit, you can step out of the shadow by using your alias or revealing more ‚Äì but that‚Äôs your choice. This inclusive approach means even those very concerned about privacy or those who just dislike making accounts can still be part of WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs community, which ultimately enriches the diversity and volume of knowledge and creativity in the platform.

Local Data Control and Export

WIRTHFORGE gives users comprehensive control over their data, especially any data related to community and social interactions. Part of the Manifesto‚Äôs promise is ‚ÄúYour data never leaves unless you send it‚Äù and ‚ÄúExport anything, anywhere, anytime‚Äù
Google Drive
. We honor that by making sure users can view, export, and manage their local data easily.

 

Transparency of Stored Data: The app provides interfaces for users to see what data has been collected/stored locally about their usage and community participation. For example:

Chat Logs & History: Users can open a history browser to see all past AI sessions and chats. This is local history (unless they explicitly shared some). They can delete any or all of these logs from local storage if they want to save space or privacy.

Community Interaction Logs: As mentioned, a log of everything they‚Äôve posted or shared. Possibly under Profile -> Activity, they see a list (‚ÄúYou posted X in forum, you uploaded Y prompt, you earned badge Z on this date.‚Äù). This is similar to how forums let you see your posts, but here it‚Äôs all aggregated and stored locally as well, giving a one-stop overview.

Data Footprint Report: We could include a feature to generate a ‚Äúdata footprint‚Äù report that summarizes what data is only local, what data has been shared online (and with whom). E.g., ‚ÄúYou have 120MB of data in local logs, 5 forum posts on server, 2 images uploaded for achievements on server.‚Äù This addresses the often unknown aspect of ‚Äúwhat does the system know about me?‚Äù by turning it into a concrete summary the user can review.

Export Functions: For any category of data, an Export button or menu option is provided. Some examples:

Export Chat Session: Saves a chat or session data to a file (possibly with various format options: plain text, JSON, maybe a special shareable format).

Export Profile & Achievements: Generates a bundle (e.g., a JSON or HTML file) with all the user‚Äôs profile info, achievements, settings. This could be used as a backup or to manually transfer to another device.

Export Community Contributions: Perhaps a user wants to leave or just archive their contributions. They can export all their forum Q&As and uploaded content in one go (like how you can download your data from many platforms). The output could be a zip with their posts in a readable form.

Export Settings: All user preferences and toggles, so they can port their configuration to a new install if needed.

These exports are in open formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown, etc.) so that the user isn‚Äôt locked into proprietary dumps. They could even parse it themselves or feed it to other tools.

 

Data Portability & Import: Hand-in-hand with export, we allow import where feasible. If a user exported their profile or a session, they can import it on another WIRTHFORGE instance (say, migrating to a new PC). If a group of users want to share data outside the official system, one could export a conversation and send it, the other could import it to view it in-app. This is aligned with not locking in data ‚Äì even if our central community died, people could share knowledge by exporting and sharing files manually.

 

Local Edit and Deletion: Users can edit or delete data on their device with confidence. Delete means truly delete (no copy hiding elsewhere). For community posts that were shared to others, deletion from local means you won‚Äôt see it, but what about the server copy? We implement ‚ÄúRight to be Forgotten‚Äù where reasonable: if a user deletes a forum post from within app and chooses ‚Äúalso remove from community‚Äù, the app will attempt to delete it on the server as well (permissions allowing). For things like leaderboards, if a user withdraws consent, future leaderboards won‚Äôt include them; if they want past entries removed, they might contact admin or, easier, we could design the leaderboards to not permanently store personal scores beyond display (like maybe aggregated anon stats but not individual history unless user keeps it).

 

Offline-first Editing: All user data can be managed offline because it‚Äôs local. If you delete a forum post offline (basically marking it), when you next connect, the app will sync that deletion to the server. If you edit a wiki page offline (if we allow offline wiki edit), it queues the update. This asynchronous capability means users can maintain control even while disconnected.

 

Encryption and Backup: Local data is stored in user-accessible form where possible (like JSON in app directory) to reinforce the idea it‚Äôs theirs. But for privacy on the device itself, we encourage using OS-level encryption or providing an encryption option for particularly sensitive data (like you might mark a conversation log as ‚Äúsecure‚Äù and it gets encrypted at rest with a password). That might be advanced usage though. At least, any sensitive tokens/keys (for integration) are stored securely.

 

For backups, aside from manual exports, we might integrate with user‚Äôs backup strategy (like if they backup their device, it grabs WIRTHFORGE data as part of it). A cloud backup service offered by us is tricky because it contradicts local-first unless done in a zero-knowledge way. Possibly, we mention that users can backup their data by saving the export to their own cloud storage if they want.

 

Audit Trails: We touched on this earlier: an advanced feature is an audit log of significant events for security‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúApp started, user logged in offline mode, turned on online mode at 10:00, posted X at 10:05‚Äù ‚Äì mainly for user‚Äôs own transparency. This could help users detect if something happened without them (like if malware got in and tried to send data, it‚Äôd show up). But such cases are unlikely and maybe beyond scope; still, an audit trail is conceptually a way to show nothing shady occurs in the background.

 

Comprehensive Delete/Uninstall: If the user uninstalls WIRTHFORGE, we ensure that all their data remains (because we promised they own their consciousness and can keep it). So ideally, an uninstall process would prompt ‚ÄúDo you want to keep your data?‚Äù If yes, it leaves the data in a known folder for them to access or import later; if no, it wipes it from disk securely. If the user wants to delete their community presence, we provide a clear path: e.g., a ‚ÄúDelete Account‚Äù button which will remove their alias and any stored personal data from the server and possibly replace their posts with ‚Äú[Deleted User]‚Äù tags. Locally, it will wipe credentials and community cache. They could still use the app offline after that as a fresh user.

 

In short, local data control and export means the user can see and manipulate their data as easily as their own files, and aren‚Äôt beholden to the app to access it. WIRTHFORGE acts more like a steward of the data on the user‚Äôs behalf, not an owner. This gives users the confidence that investing time and creativity into WIRTHFORGE isn‚Äôt a one-way street ‚Äì they can always take the fruits of their labor elsewhere or keep them privately, fulfilling the promise of no lock-in and true data ownership.

Community Safety Measures

While WIRTHFORGE emphasizes user empowerment and minimal intervention, we still implement several community safety measures to protect users from harm and ensure the community remains a welcoming space. These measures work alongside the moderation tools discussed, focusing on preventive and protective aspects.

 

Content Filtering (Local AI Moderation): One innovative approach is using AI models locally to assist in moderation and safety:

The app includes a lightweight content filter model (running on the user‚Äôs machine) that evaluates content the user is about to post for flags like hate speech, personal data, or other guideline violations. If triggered, it gives the user a gentle nudge: ‚ÄúYour message contains language that might be against community guidelines or reveal personal info. Are you sure you want to post it?‚Äù This happens client-side, so no external party sees the content, maintaining privacy while still promoting caution. The user can still post if they insist (we‚Äôre not outright blocking on client side, just warning). But often this heads-up can prevent impulsive harmful posts or accidents.

Similarly, incoming content (like messages or posts others made) could be filtered for the user if they have a safety mode on. For example, a ‚ÄúSafe Mode‚Äù toggle could run all incoming community text through a local classifier to blur out slurs or NSFW content. It‚Äôs like user-controlled content moderation for consumption. The advantage of doing it locally is no censorship by a central authority ‚Äì the user chooses their comfort level.

Spam and Bot Protection: To keep the community free of spam or malicious bots, we have measures like:

Rate limits: New users can only post certain number of times per hour, etc., (as described in trust levels).

Email or Captcha on sign-up: If we allow completely anonymous signup without email, we might rely on device fingerprint or usage patterns. If abuse grows, we might consider optional email verification or other proofs for higher trust actions. But we'd try to avoid CAPTCHAs integrated, perhaps using behavior analysis (like a bot posting 100 messages quickly will get auto-flagged).

Server-side spam detection: The server could use known spam phrases or links blacklist to auto-reject posts containing those. But those rules come from community consensus or known patterns, not heavy surveillance of user content. Many forums do maintain an automated spam filter (like Akismet for WordPress) ‚Äì we might incorporate something similar purely to catch obvious spam (gambling ads, etc.). Any automated removal will be logged and reviewable by moderators to avoid false positives.

User Safety and Harassment Tools: On top of block/mute, we add:

Report Abuse: Already covered, but specifically for harassment or inappropriate content, making it easy for targets or witnesses to report. The UI might have quick reason selections (‚ÄúHarassment‚Äù, ‚ÄúHate speech‚Äù, ‚ÄúPornographic spam‚Äù, etc.) to expedite handling.

Emergency Help: If a user feels threatened or extremely uncomfortable, we could provide a link to resources (like in some communities if someone mentions self-harm, the system surfaces helpline info ‚Äì perhaps beyond our scope, but something to consider if AI is involved with user emotional state).

Conflict Resolution Mechanisms: Perhaps if two users get into a heated argument, moderators or a system could suggest mediation or cooling-off period rather than immediately banning. This is more social practice than a feature, but we might incorporate guideline statements that encourage reaching out amicably or using private messages to resolve misunderstandings, etc., provided it‚Äôs not a serious violation scenario.

Community Guidelines Prominence: We ensure the Community Guidelines (WF-BIZ-007) are highly visible and integrated. For instance:

Upon first joining the community features, user gets a quick tutorial or must scroll through a summarized ‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù and agree.

When writing a post, a subtle reminder might be shown like ‚ÄúRemember the five principles: Respect, etc.‚Äù drawn from the guidelines ethos
Google Drive
.

If a user‚Äôs content is removed or they are warned, the warning cites the specific guideline they violated (education-focused, e.g., ‚ÄúYour comment was removed for harassment, which goes against our guideline: ‚ÄòRespect amplifies collective power‚Äô
Google Drive
. Please keep discussions civil.‚Äù).

Safe Community Design: There are design choices in the UI to discourage dogpiling or abuse:

No visible ‚Äúdislike counts‚Äù that could be used to mob someone (we use positive reinforcement mainly).

If a thread is getting toxic, mods can enable slow-mode or temporarily restrict posting frequency, giving time to cool off.

Private messaging might be limited such that a new user can‚Äôt mass-message many others (prevents harassment sprees or unsolicited ads).

Possibly an ignore group feature: e.g., if some users don‚Äôt want to see content from a particular path (Forge/Scholar/Sage bias scenarios), they could filter it. But ideally cross-path respect is encouraged so hopefully not needed.

Safety for Younger Users: If any portion of the user base might be minors, we might provide additional safety ‚Äì like a parental control or a ‚ÄúPG mode‚Äù that filters more content. Though WIRTHFORGE is not specifically marketed to children, we can‚Äôt rule out younger enthusiasts. In any case, all content is user-generated so the community guidelines should keep it generally professional/academic in tone, not extremely adult. If NSFW or very adult topics come up, likely guidelines would restrict that or partition it clearly.

 

Security Measures: Community safety also means technical security:

Ensure all communications are encrypted (we do that via TLS on connections, etc., to prevent eavesdropping).

Provide authenticity cues: e.g., if we had plugin sharing, a way to verify a plugin‚Äôs integrity (so users don‚Äôt download tampered content).

Regular security audits of the platform to close any vulnerabilities that could be exploited for things like user data scraping or impersonation.

Encourage users to update if a critical security fix is out (the app might notify about important updates relevant to online safety).

Monitoring and Improvement: Though we minimize surveillance, the health of the community is monitored in aggregate by the team. E.g., track number of reports, common issues, etc., to see where to improve guidelines or features. We could have periodic community town halls (virtually) to discuss any safety concerns, letting user input guide adjustments (this aligns with ‚Äúcommunity-driven discovery‚Äù and governance ethos).

 

In conclusion, the community safety measures ensure that while users have freedom and privacy, there are sensible guardrails to prevent and address the worst behaviors. They work mostly behind-the-scenes or via empowering users (rather than heavy admin policing) to maintain a space that is friendly, trustworthy, and safe for all conscientious participants. This encourages more users to engage, knowing that if something bad happens, tools are there to handle it quickly and fairly, and ideally to prevent it wherever possible.

üéØ Generated Assets Inventory
Mermaid Diagrams (3 files) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

Social Architecture Overview: /assets/diagrams/WF-UX-008-social-architecture.mmd ‚Äì A diagram illustrating the architecture of WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs social layer, including local components (social module, local DB), consent flow, and optional connections to community servers or external platforms. It shows how data moves from a user‚Äôs device to the community and back, emphasizing points where user approval is required and how multiple users/devices interact (for instance, in a collaborative session or leaderboard update). (This corresponds to the flow described under Social Architecture and depicted in the sequence/flow diagrams above.)

Privacy Flow (Consent & Anonymity): /assets/diagrams/WF-UX-008-privacy-flow.mmd ‚Äì A detailed sequence diagram of the data sharing consent process and anonymity options. It covers a typical user action (like submitting a challenge score) and branches for consent given or denied
GitHub
, as well as illustrating how an anonymous post is handled differently (no user identity revealed). The diagram highlights components like the Consent Dialog, local Privacy Filter, and data routes (encrypted channel) to show how privacy is preserved at each step.

Community Structure & Roles: /assets/diagrams/WF-UX-008-community-structure.mmd ‚Äì A structural diagram (e.g., a mindmap or hierarchical chart) mapping out the community features and roles. It depicts the relationships between Users, Mentors, Moderators (with trust levels)
blog.discourse.org
, and platforms (Forums, Wiki, Discord, Twitch). It visualizes sub-communities (Forge/Scholar/Sage paths as groups) and shared spaces like the Community Wiki. The goal is to show how the community is organized and the flow of knowledge and moderation: e.g., users contribute to content libraries, mentors guide newcomers, moderators oversee guidelines, and all paths intersect in the collective knowledge base.

JSON Schemas (3 files) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

Social Profile & Data Schema: /assets/schemas/WF-UX-008-social-data.json ‚Äì Defines the structure for social profile data and achievement sharing. It includes fields for userAlias, userId (local-only or hashed), badges (array of achievements with minimal info for sharing), consentSettings (booleans for each shareable category), and possibly a publicProfile subset (what info is sent to server). Also covers the format for shared achievement objects (achievementId, title, metrics, timestamp) that would be posted to leaderboards or feeds. This schema ensures consistency in how user social data is stored locally and represented when optionally synced.

Privacy Settings Schema: /assets/schemas/WF-UX-008-privacy-settings.json ‚Äì A schema detailing all privacy and consent toggles and their default states. Fields like allowLeaderboard (default false), allowMentorAccess (false), shareAlias (true by default, since alias is non-identifying), etc., as well as nested structures for consent logs (each entry logging feature name, consentGiven (T/F), date, context). This schema is used to validate the Privacy Dashboard configuration and ensures that any new social feature must declare a consent flag here before it can transmit data.

Community Guidelines & Roles Schema: /assets/schemas/WF-UX-008-community-rules.json ‚Äì A formal schema capturing aspects of governance and moderation configuration. It might include role definitions (e.g., roles: {‚ÄúnewUser‚Äù: capabilities‚Ä¶, ‚ÄútrustedUser‚Äù: capabilities‚Ä¶,‚Äùmoderator‚Äù: capabilities‚Ä¶}), and guideline categories (with codes for harassment, spam, etc., and associated actions/penalties). It can also outline the trust level thresholds (like Discourse trust levels: TL1 requires X, TL2 requires Y
blog.discourse.org
blog.discourse.org
) in a data-driven way. Additionally, structures for report handling (e.g., {"violationType": "harassment", "autoHideThreshold": 5 flags, "penalties": {"firstOffense":"warning","repeat":"tempBan"}}). This schema helps the system and community administrators adjust moderation logic in a transparent, configurable manner.

Code Modules (4 files) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

Community Hub Component: /deliverables/code/WF-UX-008/WF-UX-008-community-hub.tsx ‚Äì A React/TypeScript implementation of the main Community Hub UI in the app. It brings together sub-components for feed, challenges, and knowledge base. Features state management for online/offline mode, and renders different views depending on user‚Äôs privacy settings (e.g., if user is offline or anonymous, it shows limited UI with prompts to enable features). The component handles retrieving cached community content and updating it when online, and orchestrates interactions like clicking on a post or submitting a rating. It includes hooks to the consent system: before posting or sending data, it calls the consent APIs. This module is central to presenting and navigating social features within the WIRTHFORGE interface.

Privacy & Consent Manager: /deliverables/code/WF-UX-008/WF-UX-008-privacy-manager.ts ‚Äì A TypeScript module that manages all privacy-related logic. It provides functions like requestConsent(feature: string, dataPreview?: any) which pops up modal dialogs and records responses, referencing the JSON schema for default settings
GitHub
. It also has utilities for anonymizing payloads (e.g., a function to strip or hash user identifiers in an object) and for enforcing settings (e.g., a wrapper that any network-send function calls to check consent first). Additionally, it could implement the local content filter (perhaps loading a pre-trained model or simple keyword list to scan outgoing text). This module essentially enforces the rule ‚Äúno data leaves without consent‚Äù at a code level across the app.

Sharing & Collaboration Utilities: /deliverables/code/WF-UX-008/WF-UX-008-sharing-utils.ts ‚Äì A collection of functions and classes supporting various sharing and collaboration features. For instance, it might include:

shareAchievement(achievementId): packages an achievement for sharing (gathers data, calls PrivacyManager to confirm, then posts to server).

initiateCollabSession(sessionId): sets up a peer connection or local server endpoint for a collaboration invite.

Data structures for content like SharedPrompt or CollabSpace with methods to serialize/deserialize them for export/import.

Methods to interface with external APIs (like Discord RPC or Twitch integration), abstracting them so that UI components can simply call shareToDiscord(event) and this utility handles the details (after ensuring user consent and token presence).

This module focuses on the functional side of sharing (the heavy lifting once UI triggers an action), leaving UI handling to components and privacy checks to PrivacyManager.

Community Moderation Engine: /deliverables/code/WF-UX-008/WF-UX-008-moderation-engine.ts ‚Äì This TypeScript module implements automated moderation and trust logic described. It includes:

The data structures from the community rules schema (parsed into in-memory config).

Functions like evaluatePostForModeration(post) which uses rules to decide if it should be auto-hidden (e.g., if it contains blacklisted words).

Handling of user reports: e.g., registerReport(postId, reporterId, reason) which logs the report and triggers actions when thresholds are met (like auto-hide).

Trust level computation: a routine that runs when user activity changes, updating their trust level if criteria met
blog.discourse.org
blog.discourse.org
. For instance, after a user has, say, 50 posts and 100 likes given, promote them to Trusted.

Enforcement functions: applyPenalty(userId, rule) that might deduct points or restrict account based on a guideline violation.

Interfaces to the UI/notifications system to inform users of moderation actions or to request moderator attention (like a queue of flags).

This engine ensures that moderation policies are consistently applied. It operates mostly in the background, triggered by events (new post, new flag, user level-up) and emits events for the UI (like ‚ÄúUser X is now Trust Level 2‚Äù or ‚ÄúPost Y hidden for spam‚Äù). By encapsulating these rules in code, we can adjust community governance by tweaking this module‚Äôs rule set, without touching other parts of the system.

Test Suites (3 files) ‚úÖ COMPLETE

Social Features Integration Tests: /deliverables/tests/WF-UX-008-social-features.spec.ts ‚Äì A comprehensive test suite that simulates user flows across social features to verify they work end-to-end. Tests include:

Achievement sharing flow: ensure that when a user earns an achievement and clicks share, the consent prompt appears, data is sent only after consent, and the feed updates for other users
GitHub
.

Challenge participation: simulate two users (using test stubs) entering a challenge and ensure the leaderboard updates correctly with opt-in and opt-out cases (one user allows submission, another denies and sees only local result).

Mentorship connection: one user flags as mentor, another requests help, test that a session can be established (likely using a mock peer connection) and that mentor only sees allowed info.

The tests use mocks for server interactions to confirm that no data is transmitted without the appropriate consent flags set, essentially serving as a regression guard against any code that might bypass PrivacyManager.

Privacy & Consent Validation Tests: /deliverables/tests/WF-UX-008-privacy-tests.spec.ts ‚Äì Focused tests on privacy features. For example:

Test that by default all online features are off (attempting an online action should result in either a no-op or a prompt for consent).

Test each consent toggle‚Äôs effect: e.g., enable leaderboards and ensure scores go through, disable again and ensure subsequent scores do not.

Verify anonymization: input a data object with userId and personal fields, run through PrivacyManager anonymizer and assert that the output has those fields removed or hashed.

Test the ‚Äúanonymous post‚Äù flow: ensure that posting with anonymous option doesn‚Äôt reveal user‚Äôs alias or ID in any part of the payload or UI, and that the server receives an anonymous marker instead.

Security tests: simulate an attempted unauthorized data send (perhaps by calling lower-level network function without consent) and ensure it‚Äôs blocked or logged appropriately. Also test that revoking consent indeed stops further transmissions and perhaps even triggers deletion requests if implemented.

Community Moderation & Safety Tests: /deliverables/tests/WF-UX-008-moderation-tests.spec.ts ‚Äì Tests to ensure moderation and safety features behave as intended:

Create dummy posts/comments with various content (harassing language, spam links, etc.) and ensure the ModerationEngine flags or auto-hides them according to rules (e.g., a post with blacklisted word triggers moderation action).

Simulate multiple reports on a post and verify it becomes hidden at the threshold, and unhidden if reports are retracted or moderator marks it safe.

Trust level progression: feed a sequence of actions (posts read, likes given, etc.) for a test user and assert that their trust level updates when criteria met, unlocking expected capabilities (like after reaching Trust Level 3, the test user should be allowed to perform an action that lower levels cannot, e.g., recategorize a topic).

Test block/ignore: mark a user as blocked and ensure that none of their content appears in the blocking user‚Äôs views (the test might check that a feed fetch does not include posts by the blocked user).

Content filter test: pass sample texts through the local content filter (via PrivacyManager or ModerationEngine) and check that it identifies disallowed content correctly (and conversely, doesn‚Äôt flag innocent content).

Also test exporting functions: ensure that when a user requests data export, the produced files contain the expected data and no unexpected data (e.g., export should include their posts but not someone else‚Äôs).

These test suites together provide high confidence that all social and community features work as designed and that the privacy/security aspects are enforced at all times, catching any regressions or bugs in future changes to WF-UX-008 components.
