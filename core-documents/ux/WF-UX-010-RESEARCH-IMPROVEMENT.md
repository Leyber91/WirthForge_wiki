WF-UX-010: User Research & Continuous Improvement
1. Research Metrics Priority

Energy engagement should take top priority, with usability and performance as supporting metrics. The WIRTHFORGE documentation consistently emphasizes “energy truth visualization” as the defining principle of the UX
GitHub
. Every computational process must be represented as energy in the UI – “what you compute is what you see” – ensuring the integrity of the energy metaphor
GitHub
. In practice, this means the primary success metric is how effectively users engage with and understand those energy-based visuals. Web interface usability is also highlighted as “critical for adoption”
GitHub
, and strict performance targets (e.g. maintaining 60 FPS with a 16.67ms frame budget) are set to preserve the fidelity of the energy feedback
GitHub
. The recommended priority order is:

Energy Engagement – Measure how users interact with and comprehend the energy visualizations (the core differentiator of WIRTHFORGE)
GitHub
. This reflects the “Scientific Honesty” mandate that all visuals map to real computations without any fabricated effects
GitHub
.

Usability – Ensure the interface supports understanding of the energy metaphors and is easy to use, since a rich web UI is mandatory for all user interactions
GitHub
GitHub
. High usability underpins energy engagement by making the visualizations accessible and intuitive.

Performance – Maintain real-time responsiveness (60Hz visuals) so that the energy feedback remains smooth and accurate
GitHub
. Meeting the 16.67ms frame budget is essential to prevent lag or stutter in the energy animations, thereby upholding the energy metaphor’s credibility
GitHub
.

By focusing on energy-centric engagement first and foremost, the platform stays true to its “energy truth” vision. Usability and performance metrics then ensure this energy visualization is delivered in a user-friendly and technically sound manner, aligning with WIRTHFORGE’s core principle of scientific honesty in UI feedback

2. Governance Flows & Approval Steps

WF-FND-006’s governance workflow diagram shows the multi-stage review process from proposal submission to board review, sandbox testing, and final production release. At each stage, core principles (local-first execution, 60 FPS performance, energy truth visualization, UI presence) must be verified as inviolable checks. The board composition and decision criteria are also illustrated, indicating that any significant change or research initiative undergoes multi-stakeholder approval before reaching end users.

Yes – incorporate comprehensive governance flows and approval steps based on the WF-FND-006 Governance framework. WIRTHFORGE’s governance documentation imposes strict oversight on any platform changes or data collection, which user research must also adhere to
GitHub
. This means every research activity (e.g. A/B tests, feature experiments, user studies) should be handled with the same rigor as code changes. Key requirements include:

Opt-In Audit Logging: All research-related events should be logged in an append-only audit trail, with user consent for any detailed logging beyond the local machine. By default, logs remain on the user’s device, and any aggregation for analysis is opt-in (privacy-respecting)
GitHub
. This ensures transparency without violating user trust.

Privacy-Preserving Analytics: Analytics data must remain local-first and anonymized unless the user explicitly chooses to share it
GitHub
. The architecture notes specify that “analytics data stays local unless explicitly shared”, reflecting a commitment to user privacy in research
GitHub
.

Study Design Approval: Just as new features go through proposal and review, any user research or experiment design should go through a formal approval process. The governance framework defines a proposal review system with set criteria and stakeholder roles
GitHub
. Before launching a user study, the team should vet it for alignment with core principles (e.g. does it respect local-first, 60FPS, energy truth?) and obtain necessary approvals (akin to an IRB or internal review board).

Data Sovereignty Controls: The process must ensure user data ownership and voluntary participation. The project notes that there is “no mandatory data collection for research” and participation is community-driven
GitHub
. In practice, this means users must opt in to any data sharing or experimental features, and they retain control over their data throughout the research.

Immutable Audit Trails: All research activities should be traceable and auditable end-to-end. WF-FND-006 calls for comprehensive audit trails so that “every change is traceable and auditable”
GitHub
. Implementing an immutable, tamper-proof log of research events (with check-sums or signing) is recommended
GitHub
. This audit trail provides accountability for user studies and allows retrospective analysis or investigation if issues arise.

In the deliverables, it’s important to include process diagrams depicting these governance flows – for example, a flowchart of how a user research proposal moves from design to approval (highlighting consent checkpoints, privacy reviews, and board approval), and how data flows are audited. By following WF-FND-006’s ethics and governance dependencies, the user research process will respect privacy, ensure transparency, and preserve core philosophy while still enabling continuous improvement

3. Role Modeling

WIRTHFORGE’s philosophy suggests keeping research roles flexible rather than rigidly predefined. The platform emphasizes user empowerment, autonomy, and community-driven participation in its evolution. For instance, the meta documentation notes “No mandatory data collection for research” and “Community-driven research participation”, indicating that users opt into research voluntarily and the community helps shape the direction
GitHub
. This ethos implies that a one-size-fits-all role hierarchy would be too restrictive.

Instead, the research framework should allow configurable team roles that can adapt to different contexts. You might provide example roles (e.g. Research Lead, UX Analyst, Participant Advocate, Data Steward), but make them templates rather than fixed requirements. Organizations implementing WIRTHFORGE can then assign responsibilities according to their needs and scale. The key is that all necessary governance functions are covered (e.g. someone to oversee ethics and privacy, someone to analyze data, etc.) without enforcing a strict formal structure that could hinder community input. This flexible approach aligns with WIRTHFORGE’s community-driven model – users and contributors can take on various research roles organically, as long as they adhere to the governance and ethics guidelines. In summary, support a clear division of concerns (ethical oversight, data analysis, feedback facilitation, etc.) but allow those roles to be fulfilled dynamically. The documentation’s emphasis on community and user autonomy reinforces that research processes should be inclusive and adaptable
GitHub
. Providing a suggested role model is fine, but it should be easy to customize or expand in practice.

4. In-App Feedback Design vs. Backend Focus

Both the in-app feedback UI and the backend analytics processes are crucial – WIRTHFORGE is explicitly a “web-engaged local-core” platform
GitHub
, which means a tight integration of rich web interface components with local (on-device) data processing. The design for WF-UX-010 should encompass front-end user experience elements and the behind-the-scenes data infrastructure:

On the UI side, include mockups or design specifications for in-app feedback and research interfaces. For example, how users will submit feedback or consent to studies within the app, and how results (or A/B test variations) might be presented back to them. These UI components should follow the established energy theme – e.g. a feedback prompt might use the energy visualization motif to confirm that a user’s input is being “energized” into the system. The importance of front-end design is stressed by the principle that “web interface usability is critical for adoption”
GitHub
. In practice, this could mean user-friendly feedback forms, visual indicators of ongoing experiments (always mapping to real computations), and perhaps a research dashboard for power users to see insights locally. WIRTHFORGE’s UX guidelines prioritize rich, interactive web interfaces at every level, so the continuous improvement loop must be visible and intuitive to the user.

On the backend side, design the data collection, analysis, and storage mechanisms for user research, adhering to privacy rules. This includes local analytics collection (instrumentation of the app to gather usage metrics or experiment results) and analysis tools that run locally or in a privacy-preserving way. The architecture notes insist that user research follow “privacy and local-first principles”, with data staying on the device unless shared by the user
GitHub
. For example, an A/B test framework might log outcome metrics to a local database, which the user can review or choose to upload. Additionally, integration with the observability and monitoring systems is expected – the project’s technical specs for observability (WF-TECH-009) describe a real-time dashboard served from the local web server
GitHub
. We should leverage similar patterns for research metrics: for instance, a local web-based dashboard could display experiment metrics, user feedback trends, and success KPIs in real time, visible only to the user or authorized researchers. This ties into WIRTHFORGE’s concept of “Web-Engaged Research” – providing rich web interfaces for research tools and validation
GitHub
, and “Privacy-Preserving Methods” – ensuring the data analysis respects user ownership of data
GitHub
.

In summary, WF-UX-010 must deliver both a compelling in-app user feedback experience and a robust back-end research infrastructure. The in-app design ensures users can easily provide input and see the platform improving (closing the feedback loop), all within the familiar energy-centric UI. The backend design handles data gathering and experimentation logic under the hood, aligning with local-first and privacy mandates. By addressing both fronts, the continuous improvement process becomes a seamless part of the WIRTHFORGE experience – users are engaged through the interface, and the system quietly learns and adapts through local analytics. This dual focus fulfills the “web-engaged local-core” philosophy, where the web UI and local computation work hand-in-hand to drive evidence-based improvements

Key Integration Points: In developing WF-UX-010, be sure to tie in the relevant modules from other parts of the project. This includes working with WF-TECH-009 (Monitoring & Observability) to leverage the metrics dashboard and alerting systems for user research data, aligning with WF-FND-006 (Governance) for ethical oversight and audit logging of experiments, and incorporating feedback channels established in WF-UX-001 (UI Architecture) for collecting user input. Continuous improvement should not violate any core WIRTHFORGE philosophies – rather, it uses those principles (local execution, energy visualization, transparency) to gather insights and evolve the product in a user-centered yet principled way
GitHub
GitHub
. Each research iteration should loop back into the design and development cycle, ensuring that user feedback truly “directly influences development priorities” as intended
GitHub
. By integrating these components, WF-UX-010 will create a sustainable pipeline for user-driven enhancement of WIRTHFORGE without compromising its core values.
