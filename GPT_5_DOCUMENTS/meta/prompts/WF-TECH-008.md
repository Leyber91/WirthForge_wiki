Generate Document: WF-TECH-008 – Observability & Metrics
Follow the universal template. Draw from FND-006 for metrics governance and FND-002 for EU/energy-fidelity KPIs. Define metrics schema (latency, frame stability, progression rate, error counts), log format, and dashboard mock-ups. Include Mermaid data-flow from source (DECIPHER, orchestrator) → storage → dashboard. JSON schema for metrics.snapshot, sample dashboard view, and test plan verifying metric accuracy and update cadence.
Requires: WF-TECH-004, WF-FND-002, WF-FND-006. Enables: WF-TECH-009.
