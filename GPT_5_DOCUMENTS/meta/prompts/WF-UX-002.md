Generate Document: WF-UX-002 – Level 2: Parallel Streams (Council)
Follow the universal template. Build on UX-001 for base flow, FND-005 for council rules, and TECH-005 for data feed. Define multi-model layout, interference visuals, consensus/divergence cues. Include session flow diagram (parallel responses → synthesis), visual mock-ups for aligned vs divergent streams, and KPI spec for consensus rate and energy amplification.
Requires: WF-UX-001, WF-TECH-005, WF-FND-005. Enables: WF-UX-003.
