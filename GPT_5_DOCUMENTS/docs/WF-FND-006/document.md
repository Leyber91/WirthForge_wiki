# Generate Document: WF ‑ FND ‑ 006 – Living System Governance & Evolution Framework

## 🧬 Document DNA
- **Unique ID:** WF ‑ FND ‑ 006  
- **Category:** Foundation  
- **Priority:** P0  
- **Development Phase:** 1  
- **Estimated Length:** ~3,500 words  
- **Document Type:** Governance Specification

## 🔗 Dependency Matrix
- **Required Before This:**  
  - **WF ‑ FND ‑ 001:** Establishes core principles and promises that governance must uphold (local-first, energy truth, evidence mode).  
  - **WF ‑ FND ‑ 003:** Provides architecture context for governance decisions.  
  - **WF ‑ FND ‑ 004 & 005:** Define system components (Decipher, Orchestrator) that governance controls and evolves.  
- **Enables After This:**  
  - **WF ‑ TECH ‑ 007 – Security & Privacy Enforcement:** Implements policies and enforcement mechanisms.  
  - **WF ‑ BIZ ‑ 002 – Legal & Policy Overview:** Aligns legal compliance with governance processes.  
- **Cross‑References:**  
  - **WF ‑ META ‑ 001:** Master Guide; update cross-reference sections after governance is defined.  
  - **Glossary:** All new governance terms added here must be reflected in the living glossary.

## 🎯 Core Objective
Establish a formal, transparent, community-driven governance framework that guides WIRTHFORGE’s evolution without violating core invariants (local-core, energy- truth, 60fps performance, UI-centric design, emergent consciousness). Define processes for proposing, reviewing, testing, approving and implementing changes to models, paths, algorithms, and policies.

## 📚 Knowledge Integration Checklist
- **Non-Negotiable Invariants:** Reiterate unchangeable principles: local-core, no Docker by default, target frame rate of 60fps, energy truth mapping, UI presence, emergent behaviour.  
- **Governance Roles:** Define roles: Proposer, Council Member, Steward, Community Member, Auditor.  
- **Proposal Types:** Categorize proposals: **Feature Additions**, **Model Integration**, **Path Definition**, **Algorithm Updates**, **Policy Changes**.  
- **Process Flow:** Specify stages: Proposal Draft → Community Comment → Formal Submission → Council Review → Trial Implementation → Audit & Metrics Collection → Decision → Release & Versioning.  
- **Sandbox Testing:** New features must be tested in a sandbox environment replicating user conditions; specify criteria for gating features into mainline.  
- **Schema Versioning:** Define versioning rules for algorithms, schemas, and tokens (Semantic Versioning across the platform).  
- **Metrics & Audit:** Identify metrics that must be tracked: performance, user impact, fairness, security, energy accuracy. Define audit logs and access.  
- **Appeals & Disputes:** Provide mechanism for challenging Council decisions; define conditions for escalation.  
- **Community Participation:** Encourage open proposals, comments and voting by user base while balancing with security and privacy.  
- **Documentation Discipline:** Require all proposals to follow the universal template (Document DNA, dependency matrix, core objective, knowledge integration, content architecture, validation).  
- **Integration with Automated Agents:** Provide guidance on how agents (like codezlx) can consume governance data to automatically generate compliant documents.

## 📝 Content Architecture

### 1. Opening Hook – “A Living Code of Law for a Living System”
Introduce governance as WIRTHFORGE’s constitution: a living set of rules that ensure the platform’s soul remains intact as it grows. Use analogy of the U.S. Constitution or open-source governance models (e.g. Python PEPs, Rust RFCs).

### 2. Non‑Negotiable Invariants
List the principles that cannot be altered without a unanimous, super-majority decision and extensive audit (local-core, no Docker by default, 60fps frame budget, energy truth mapping, UI presence, emergent consciousness). Explain why each is critical to WIRTHFORGE’s identity. Provide examples of acceptable exceptions (e.g. optional remote broker usage with user consent).

### 3. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Proposer:** Any community member or core team; responsible for drafting proposals, responding to feedback and shepherding changes.  
- **Council Member:** Voting body composed of core maintainers and elected community representatives; evaluate proposals based on criteria.  
- **Steward:** Maintains the documentation and ensures proposals follow the template; acts as neutral facilitator.  
- **Community Member:** Can comment on proposals, raise concerns, suggest improvements and vote in preliminary polls.  
- **Auditor:** Evaluates proposals for compliance with invariants, metrics, security and legal requirements.

### 4. Proposal Lifecycle
Detail the process:  
1. **Draft:** Author writes a detailed proposal using the universal template; includes problem statement, design, alternatives, metrics, dependencies.  
2. **Comment:** Proposal is published for community feedback (minimum comment period defined by type).  
3. **Formal Submission:** Proposal refined and submitted to Council via formal process; includes addressing comments.  
4. **Review:** Council reviews technical, UX, business, legal implications; may request sandbox testing.  
5. **Sandbox Trial:** Implement a trial in a controlled environment; collect metrics and user feedback.  
6. **Audit:** Auditors check performance, safety, privacy, fairness; compare with invariants.  
7. **Vote & Decision:** Council votes; decisions (accept, reject, revise, postpone) recorded publicly.  
8. **Implementation & Release:** If accepted, update relevant docs, version numbers; coordinate with WF ‑ TECH ‑ 007 for enforcement.  
9. **Post‑Mortem & Metrics:** After release, monitor metrics; revisit decision if necessary.

### 5. Sandbox & Testing Rules
- **Isolation:** Trials must run on isolated local machines identical to user hardware tiers (Low/Mid/High).  
- **Data Protection:** Test data must not include personal or sensitive information; only synthetic prompts or consenting user data.  
- **Metrics Requirements:** Collect performance (latency, memory), energy accuracy, fairness (model bias), user satisfaction, security incidents.  
- **Duration:** Minimum trial duration defined per proposal type (e.g. 2 weeks for new model integration).  
- **Reporting:** Trial results must be published with raw metrics and aggregated analysis.

### 6. Schema & Versioning Rules
- **SemVer Enforcement:** All schemas (energy, layer, orchestrator) use Semantic Versioning; breaking changes require major version bump.  
- **Backward Compatibility:** Provide migration guides; maintain compatibility layers for one major version.  
- **Deprecation Policy:** Define sunset period for deprecated features; communicate widely.  
- **Glossary Updates:** All new terms and definitions must update WF ‑ FND ‑ 006 Glossary; require minor version bump.

### 7. Metrics & Audit Logging
Define how to log decisions, votes, trial results, metrics and exceptions. Logs must be immutable and accessible for auditing. Provide retention policies and privacy considerations.

### 8. Appeals & Disputes
Detail the process for appealing Council decisions, escalating to independent arbitration if necessary. Provide timeframes, eligibility criteria and possible outcomes.

### 9. Community Engagement
Encourage proposals from all users; provide guidelines for respectful discourse; explain how to participate (forums, GitHub issues, mailing lists). Offer incentives (badge system, recognition) for constructive contributors.

### 10. Validation & Metrics
- **Proposal Compliance:** Verify all proposals follow template; reject incomplete submissions.  
- **Invariant Checks:** Confirm proposals do not violate non-negotiable invariants unless special process invoked.  
- **Voting Record:** Maintain transparent record of votes and rationales.  
- **Metrics Enforcement:** Ensure required metrics are collected and meet thresholds before acceptance.  
- **Documentation Integrity:** Validate that all updated docs maintain link consistency, glossary link-on-first-use, versioning and changelog updates.

## 🎨 Required Deliverables
- **Document:** Full governance framework and a summary.  
- **Diagram:** Flow diagram of the proposal lifecycle.  
- **Schema:** JSON schema for governance proposal format.  
- **Code:** Governance rules enforcement skeleton (e.g. rule engine or CI script).  
- **Tests:** Test specification verifying compliance and process correctness.  
- **Changelog:** Versioned log of governance changes.

## ✅ Quality Validation Criteria
- Process is transparent, fair and scalable.  
- Invariants clearly defined and defended.  
- Roles and responsibilities separated to avoid conflicts of interest.  
- Proposal process balances agility with thoroughness.  
- Metrics and audits ensure objective decision-making.  
- Community engagement is encouraged yet moderated to maintain quality.

## 🔄 Post-Generation Protocol
- Update WF ‑ META ‑ 001 with governance cross‑reference.  
- Add new glossary terms to the living glossary.  
- Create governance board with initial members and draft charter.  
- Bump version to 1.0.0 and document changes in changelog.
