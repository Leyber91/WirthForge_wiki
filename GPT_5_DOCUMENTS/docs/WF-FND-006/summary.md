# WF ‑ FND ‑ 006 Executive Summary

## Purpose
Provide a transparent, community-driven framework to manage WIRTHFORGE’s evolution while safeguarding foundational principles (local-first, energy truth, 60fps performance, UI-centric design, emergent consciousness).

## Key Elements
- **Non‑Negotiable Invariants:** Core principles cannot be changed without exceptional consensus and audit.  
- **Roles & Process:** Defines Proposers, Council Members, Stewards, Community Members and Auditors. Outlines a multi-stage proposal lifecycle: Draft → Comment → Formal Submission → Council Review → Sandbox Trial → Audit → Decision → Release.  
- **Testing & Metrics:** Requires sandbox trials replicating user environments; metrics collected on performance, fairness, energy accuracy, security and user satisfaction.  
- **Schema & Versioning:** Enforces Semantic Versioning for all schemas and algorithms; requires migration guides for breaking changes.  
- **Appeals & Engagement:** Provides mechanisms for appeals and encourages broad community participation with guidelines for respectful discourse.  
- **Audit & Documentation:** Maintains immutable logs of decisions and metrics; ensures all new terms update the glossary and changelogs.

## Implementation
- Governed by a Council with community representation; supported by Stewards and Auditors.  
- Integrated into development pipelines via governance-proposal schemas and rule engines.  
- Aligns with legal and policy requirements (WF ‑ BIZ ‑ 002) and security enforcement (WF ‑ TECH ‑ 007).

## Outcome
This framework transforms WIRTHFORGE governance from ad-hoc decision-making to a disciplined, transparent and participatory process, ensuring the platform evolves sustainably while retaining its soul.
