## Document Metadata
- **Document ID**: WF-BIZ-002
- **Title**: Legal & Policy Overview
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Executive Summary
This specification outlines the privacy, licensing, and consent policies that govern WIRTHFORGE. All data remains local unless explicit consent permits export.

## Core Concepts
- **Data Residency**: User data never leaves the device without consent.
- **Consent Ledger**: Each export event is signed and stored.
- **License Compliance**: Models and plugins carry usage licenses tracked via energy credits.

## Implementation Details
The data policy map enumerates collected data types, their retention, and sharing rules. Consent flow ensures every external sync prompts the user and records the grant locally.

## Integration Points
- **WF-TECH-003 â€“ Real-Time Protocol** for transmitting consent signals.
- **WF-TECH-004 â€“ State Management** stores consent records.

## Validation & Metrics
- **Consent Response Time**: UI surfaces decision within 500â€¯ms.
- **Retention Audits**: Automated check ensures expired data purged.
- **License Violations**: Zero tolerated unauthorized exports.
