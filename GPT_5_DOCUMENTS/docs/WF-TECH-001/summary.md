# WF-TECH-001 – Runtime Backbone & Process Graph (Summary)

- Orchestrator supervises DECIPHER, transport, and energy state services.
- C4 diagrams and YAML manifest document processes, priorities, and threads.
- Boot sequence reaches 60 Hz within 2 s and validates heartbeat, port bind, and state readiness.
- Rust stub illustrates deterministic process initialisation with restart handling.
- Establishes seams for compiler, transport, and state modules.
