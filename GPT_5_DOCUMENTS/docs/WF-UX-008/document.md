## Executive Summary
The onboarding flow guides new users through the Three Doorsâ€”Forge, Scholar, and Sageâ€”configuring preferences and establishing trust before Levelâ€¯1 gameplay begins.

## Core Concepts
- **Door Selection**: Users pick a path aligned with their goals.

    doors --> forge[Forge]
    doors --> scholar[Scholar]
    doors --> sage[Sage]
    forge --> finish[Ready]
    scholar --> finish
    sage --> finish
```
Events schema:
```json
{
  "event": "door_chosen",
  "door": "forge",
  "timestamp": 0
}
```
Screen illustrations depict each door with iconography matching the energy metaphor.
