# WF-UX-002: Level 2 â€“ Parallel Streams

## Document Metadata
- **Document ID**: WF-UX-002
- **Title**: Level 2 â€“ Parallel Streams
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: 2025-01-12
- **Status**: Draft
- **Dependencies**: WF-UX-001, WF-UX-006, WF-TECH-003
- **Enables**: WF-UX-003

## Executive Summary
Level 2 introduces council mode where multiple local models emit energy in parallel. The user witnesses several synchronized streams and can compare responses, establishing trust through consensus and divergence visualization.

## Core Concepts
- **Council of Models**: Two or more models answering simultaneously.
- **Stream Labels**: Each stream tagged with colour and identity.
- **Interference View**: Visual overlay highlighting agreement or conflict between streams.

## Implementation Details
Council topology:
```mermaid

    user --> modelA
    user --> modelB
    modelA -->|stream A| merge
    modelB -->|stream B| merge
    merge --> ui[UI]
```
Interference overlay is rendered by comparing token parity across streams and colouring nodes when divergence exceeds a threshold.

## Integration Points
- **WF-TECH-003 â€“ Real-Time Protocol** for multiplexed websocket channels.
- **WF-TECH-004 â€“ State Management** to log per-stream outputs.
- **WF-UX-006 â€“ Visualization Spec** for particle colours and overlays.

## Validation & Metrics
- **Consensus Ratio**: Percentage of matching tokens between streams.
- **Stream Latency Spread**: Max difference in response times.
- **User Control**: Ability to mute or pin streams within 1 click.

## ðŸŽ¨ Required Deliverables
- [x] Core document (this file)
- [x] Summary â€“ `docs/WF-UX-002/summary.md`
- [x] Council topology diagram â€“ `assets/diagrams/WF-UX-002-council-topology.mmd`
- [x] Interference figure â€“ `assets/figures/WF-UX-002-interference.svg`
- [x] Telemetry test â€“ `tests/WF-UX-002/consensus-telemetry.spec.js`
- [x] Version control changelog

## âœ… Quality Criteria
- Streams render within 50â€¯ms of each other.
- Consensus ratio computed deterministically.
- UI clearly indicates which model produced each token.
- All assets conform to naming and numbering policy.
