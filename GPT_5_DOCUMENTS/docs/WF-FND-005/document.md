## Overview
The Orchestrator bridges the Decipher's energy events and higher-level UX layers. It schedules frames, routes channels, and harmonizes state across the system.

## Core Loop
1. Collect emissions from the Decipher.
2. Schedule frame execution at 60Â Hz.
3. Dispatch events to registered channels.

## Channel Routing
Meridian channels connect subsystems like memory, UI, and external plugins. The Orchestrator ensures deterministic delivery while honoring local-first boundaries.

## Privacy & Local-first
All orchestration occurs locally; network adapters are optional and sandboxed.

## Conclusion
WF-FND-005 completes the foundational runtime layer, preparing the system for interactive experiences.
