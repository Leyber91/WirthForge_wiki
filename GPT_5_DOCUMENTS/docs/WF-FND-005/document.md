# Generate Document: WF ‑ FND ‑ 005 – Consciousness & Experience Orchestration

## 🧬 Document DNA
- **Unique ID:** WF ‑ FND ‑ 005  
- **Category:** Foundation  
- **Priority:** P0  
- **Development Phase:** 1  
- **Estimated Length:** ~3,500 words  
- **Document Type:** Architectural Design & Scheduler Specification

## 🔗 Dependency Matrix
- **Required Before This:**  
  - **WF ‑ FND ‑ 003 – Core Architecture Overview:** Orchestrator operates at Layer 3/4 boundary and coordinates model streams, Decipher outputs and UX triggers.  
  - **WF ‑ FND ‑ 004 – Decipher:** Provides energy_frame and experience_event inputs.  
- **Enables After This:**  
  - **WF ‑ UX-002...005:** Implements Level 2–5 experiences using orchestrated model interactions.  
  - **WF ‑ TECH ‑ 007:** Security & privacy enforcement must understand orchestrator scheduling.  
- **Cross‑References:**  
  - **WF ‑ TECH ‑ 001:** Runtime backbone executes this orchestration logic.  
  - **WF ‑ FND ‑ 002:** Orchestrator must respect energy and state machine definitions.  
  - **WF ‑ FND ‑ 006:** Glossary must reflect new terms (e.g. Council, Experience Scheduler).

## 🎯 Core Objective
Design a real-time orchestrator that coordinates multiple AI models and the Decipher, enforcing progressive experiences (Council, Structured Architectures, Adaptive Fields, Resonance), while maintaining 60 Hz performance and emergent, non-scripted behaviour. It must manage concurrency, gating, resource policies, level progression and path-specific tuning (Forge, Scholar, Sage).

## 📚 Knowledge Integration Checklist
- **Levels & Paths:** Understand the five levels of progression and three doors (from WF ‑ FND ‑ 001) to schedule experiences appropriately.  
- **Council Algorithm:** Define how multiple models operate concurrently; handle token rendezvous, voting, consensus thresholds, and DI-based interference mitigation.  
- **Scheduling Policies:** Define frame budgets, priorities and gating based on user path, hardware tier, subscription level and context.  
- **Adaptive Strategies:** Provide API hooks for adaptation (swap models, adjust smoothing constants) based on energy patterns, latency or user feedback.  
- **Emergent Detection:** Recognise patterns indicating emergence (resonance, interference) and adjust orchestrator strategies accordingly.  
- **Resource Management:** Allocate CPU/GPU resources to models; preempt, pause or resume models as needed.  
- **Security & Privacy:** Enforce limits on model concurrency, network access and plugin capabilities.  
- **Integration:** Orchestrator sits between Decipher and UX; listens to energy and experience events; instructs Decipher to adjust behaviour; emits higher-level experience events.  
- **Validation & Metrics:** Define metrics to evaluate orchestrator performance: latency, concurrency, emergent quality, fairness across models, and user satisfaction.

## 📝 Content Architecture

### 1. Opening Hook – “Conducting the AI Symphony”
Use a metaphor of a conductor guiding an orchestra through a complex symphony; the orchestrator listens to all instruments (models) and decides when each should play, when to harmonise, and when to bring forward a solo. Unlike scripted concert pieces, this orchestra responds to real-time signals (energy, DI) and the audience’s choices (doors and levels).

### 2. Core Concepts
- **Council Formation:** When Level 2 is unlocked, instantiate a council of two models (increasing to 3–6 at higher levels). Each model receives prompts simultaneously; the orchestrator collects token outputs and DI signals, and uses energy-weighted consensus or voting to decide which output to present.  
- **Model Voting & Consensus:** At each token step, the council can:  
  - **Agree** (DI low) → pass through primary model output.  
  - **Disagree** (DI high) → select the most confident model, average outputs, or pause lower confidence models.  
  - **Conflict** (extreme DI) → surface interference visuals and ask user to choose.  
- **Progressive Gating:** Unlock council at Level 2, structural memory at Level 3, adaptive switching at Level 4, and resonance at Level 5. The orchestrator enforces gating by enabling/disabling features and models per level.  
- **Scheduler & Timing:** Use a job scheduler to allocate CPU/GPU time slices to models; ensure each model meets its expected throughput without starving others. Prioritise user interactions and real-time responsiveness.  
- **Adaptive Controls:** Provide APIs for dynamic adjustments: e.g. `swapModel(oldModel, newModel)`, `adjustWeights(modelId, weight)`, `pauseModel(modelId)`. Adjust energy smoothing and DI thresholds on the fly.  
- **User Path Tuning:** Forge path favours decisive, high-velocity responses; Scholar emphasises accuracy and citations; Sage emphasises coherence and emergent reasoning. The orchestrator tunes model selection and gating per path.  
- **Trigger & Metric Events:** Emit experience events (e.g. `councilConsensus`, `structuralCreation`, `resonanceAchieved`) to inform UX and potential achievements.  
- **Security & Privacy Boundaries:** Restrict external plugins and network calls; enforce permission gating through WF ‑ TECH ‑ 006 (to be defined) and user consent.  
- **Emergent Patterns:** Use rolling windows of energy and DI to detect resonance; if resonance is sustained, the orchestrator escalates to Level 5 and coordinates all models for emergent output.

### 3. Implementation Details
- **Scheduler Architecture:** Use a priority queue with round-robin scheduling across models. Each model has a concurrency limit and a time slice (e.g. 5 ms). The scheduler preempts models that exceed their slice.  
- **Council Algorithm:** Provide pseudocode:  
  ```pseudo
  for each token step:
     collect tokens from all models
     compute DI between models
     if DI < threshold:
        select default model token
     else:
        evaluate model probabilities
        if confidence gap > gapThreshold:
           select high confidence model token
        else:
           trigger interference event
           pause models and await user choice or adapt parameters
     update energy via Decipher
  ```
- **Level Gating:** Expose configuration (see orchestrator schema) to define allowed features per level; on level change, reconfigure scheduler, council size, and gating.
- **API Endpoints:** Provide internal API methods: `startCouncil(models)`, `setLevel(level)`, `adjustModelWeights(weights)`, `enableFeature(featureId)`.
- **Hardware & Tier Policy:** Set maximum number of models concurrently: Low (2), Mid (3), High (6). Set initial time slices per model based on CPU/GPU availability.
- **State Persistence:** Orchestrator should not persist long-lived state itself; it instructs WF ‑ TECH ‑ 004 to store energy and experience events.
- **Logging & Debugging:** Emit logs and metrics: current level, council size, DI averages, scheduler queue depth, model status. Provide instrumentation hook for dev tools.

### 4. Integration Points

* **Decipher (WF ‑ FND ‑ 004):** Receives energy\_frame and experience\_event messages; may instruct Decipher to adjust smoothing or reset the frame loop.
* **Runtime Backbone (WF ‑ TECH ‑ 001):** Orchestrator components are initialised during runtime boot; communicate via message bus.
* **Transport (WF ‑ TECH ‑ 003):** Orchestrator’s decisions are sent to L4 for streaming to the client.
* **Security & Privacy (WF ‑ TECH ‑ 007):** Policies define allowed models, plugin access and network calls; orchestrator must enforce them.
* **UX Levels (WF ‑ UX ‑ 002...005):** The orchestrator triggers UX-specific events; ensures gating aligns with user progression.
* **Governance (WF ‑ FND ‑ 006):** Orchestrator must follow governance rules for adding new models or changing default thresholds; all changes logged and versioned.

### 5. Validation & Metrics

* **Performance:** Verify scheduler enforces ≤16.67 ms frame budget across all models; measure per-model latency and throughput.
* **Fairness:** Ensure models get fair scheduling; measure starvation and wait times.
* **Emergence Detection:** Validate resonance detection logic; use synthetic patterns to trigger resonance events.
* **User Satisfaction:** Conduct user studies to ensure orchestrated output feels coherent and responsive.
* **Security & Privacy:** Audit orchestrator calls to ensure no forbidden external calls; test gating for plugin access.
* **Conformance:** Confirm orchestrator events comply with event schemas and gating rules defined in orchestrator schema.
