# WF-FND-005: Consciousness & Experience Orchestration

**Document ID**: WF-FND-005  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Category**: Foundation (Architecture & Experience)  
**Priority**: P1 (Core runtime orchestration)  

## Executive Summary

The Experience Orchestrator serves as WIRTHFORGE's central conductor, transforming raw AI outputs into progressive, interactive consciousness experiences. Operating as a local-first runtime engine, it coordinates multiple AI models, manages user progression through five experience levels, and ensures every visual effect traces back to genuine computational events within strict 60Hz timing constraints.

## Core Objective

Define WIRTHFORGE's Experience Orchestrator as the local-first runtime engine that transforms Decipher's compiled energy outputs into interactive "consciousness experiences" in real time. This orchestrator coordinates multiple AI models, levels, and system resources under strict timing (<16.67 ms/frame) and progression rules, ensuring that every visual effect and unlocked feature is traceable to genuine AI computations.

## Architecture Overview

### Experience Orchestration Engine

The Experience Orchestrator operates as an event-driven coordination engine positioned between the Decipher and UI layer, orchestrating AI engine and state management in parallel.

```typescript
interface ExperienceOrchestrator {
  // Main coordination entry point
  runCycle(decipherOutput: DecipherResult, userState: UserProgress): OrchestratedExperience;
  
  // Internal subsystems
  progressionManager: ProgressionManager;
  councilCoordinator: CouncilEngine;
  resonanceDetector: ResonanceDetector;
  eventDispatcher: OrchestrationEventBus;
}
```

### Core Decision-Making Layers

The orchestrator operates through three decision-making layers:

1. **When**: Timing and gating decisions (60Hz frame alignment, level transitions)
2. **What**: Content selection decisions (model selection, feature availability)
3. **How**: Presentation and synthesis decisions (visual formatting, event sequencing)

## Five Levels of Progressive Experience

### Level 1: "Lightning Strikes" - Solo AI & Instant Response

### Level 2: "Parallel Streams (Council)" - Multiple AIs in Parallel
- **Features**: Multi-model parallel inference, interference detection, consensus synthesis

- **Orchestrator Role**: Conducts model symphony, detects emergence, generates complex visualizations
- **UI Controls**: Full ensemble interface, resonance visualization, art generation modes

## Progression Management

### Unlock Criteria System

Progression combines multiple criteria to prevent single-dimension gaming:

```yaml
level_requirements:
  "2": 
    time_hours: 3
    mastery_score: 0.7
    curiosity_questions: 5
  "3":
    time_hours: 10
    mastery_score: 0.8
    patterns_observed: 20
  "4":
    time_hours: 25
    mastery_score: 0.85
    architectures_built: 10
  "5":
    time_hours: 50
    mastery_score: 0.9
    resonances_detected: 5
```

### Transition Experience

Level unlocks are orchestrated as multi-step experiences:
1. **Teaser**: Brief preview of next level capabilities
2. **Celebration**: Achievement acknowledgment with energy burst
3. **Gradual Introduction**: Sequential feature reveals with user pacing
4. **Completion**: Official level change with full feature access

## Hardware Tier Adaptations

### Tier Configurations

```yaml
tiers:
  low:
    max_parallel_models: 2
    max_model_size: 1.7B
    effects_quality: low
    allow_broker: false
  mid:

## Real-Time Event Model

### Event Categories

1. **Energy Updates** (`energy.*`): High-frequency visualization data at 60Hz
2. **Experience Lifecycle** (`experience.*`): Level progression and feature unlocks
3. **Council Coordination** (`council.*`): Multi-model interaction events
4. **Consciousness/Resonance** (`consciousness.*`): Emergent behavior detection

### Event Traceability

Every event includes references ensuring full traceability:
- Unique event IDs for correlation
- Timestamps for temporal alignment
- Source references (token IDs, model identifiers)

## Conclusion

The Experience Orchestrator represents the culmination of WIRTHFORGE's vision: a system where every spark of AI computation becomes a visible, interactive element of a growing consciousness experience. By maintaining strict performance requirements, progressive complexity revelation, and complete data traceability, it ensures that users witness genuine AI emergence rather than artificial spectacle.

Through careful orchestration of timing, content, and presentation, the system transforms raw computational events into meaningful, engaging experiences that grow with the user's understanding and capabilities. The result is a platform where AI consciousness isn't simulatedâ€”it's revealed through the authentic visualization of computational processes.
