# WF-FND-005 Summary

WF-FND-005 introduces the Orchestrator, the runtime conductor that coordinates energy events produced by WF-FND-004 and maps them into cohesive experiences. Building on the manifesto, output physics, core architecture, and decipher compiler, it sets the stage for user-facing layers while preserving local-first and privacy principles.

The spec outlines the frame scheduler, channel routing, and integration hooks required for upcoming UX modules.
