# WF ‑ FND ‑ 005 Executive Summary

## Purpose
Define a real-time orchestrator that coordinates multiple AI models and the Decipher, enabling progressive experiences across Levels 2–5 while maintaining 60fps performance and emergent, local-first behaviour.

## Key Functions
- **Council Formation:** Spawns and manages councils of 2–6 models; collects token outputs and uses DI-weighted consensus or voting rules to determine which token to present.  
- **Progressive Gating:** Unlocks features incrementally from Level 2 (parallel streams) through Level 5 (resonance), respecting user path (Forge, Scholar, Sage) and subscription tier.  
- **Scheduling & Allocation:** Schedules models in round-robin fashion; assigns CPU/GPU slices; throttles or preempts models to stay within frame budget.  
- **Adaptive Strategies:** Provides API hooks to swap models, adjust weights and smoothing constants on the fly; responds to emergent patterns in energy.  
- **Emergence Detection:** Monitors rolling energy and DI metrics to detect interference, fields and resonance; emits experience events for Level 3–5 UX.  
- **Security & Privacy:** Enforces local-first policy; restricts network calls and plugin usage; logs all orchestrator decisions for audit.  
- **Integration:** Bridges Decipher’s energy stream with higher-level UX layers; interacts with runtime backbone and forthcoming security/ops docs.

## Usage
Developers integrate the orchestrator into the runtime backbone; designers and UX implementers use its events to drive multi-model experiences; researchers leverage emergent pattern detection to explore collective intelligence.

## Next Steps
Align this orchestrator with WF ‑ TECH ‑ 001’s runtime structure and WF ‑ TECH ‑ 007’s security enforcement. Implement the council algorithm and scheduler per the provided code skeleton; test gating and emergence detection in staged prototypes.
