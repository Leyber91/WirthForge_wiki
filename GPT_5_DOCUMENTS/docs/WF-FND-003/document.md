# WF-FND-003: Core Architecture Overview

## Document Metadata
- **Document ID**: WF-FND-003
- **Title**: Core Architecture Overview
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: 2025-01-12
- **Status**: Draft
- **Dependencies**: WF-FND-001, WF-FND-002
- **Enables**: WF-TECH-001, WF-UX-006

## Executive Summary

WF-FND-003 defines the five-layer architecture that turns raw model computation into a real-time, observable experience. The architecture enforces clear boundaries from user input through transport, orchestration, and final visualization, ensuring local-first control while remaining extensible for optional remote compute. Each layer communicates through structured events at a 60â€¯Hz cadence, enabling precise energy tracking and auditability.

## Layer Overview

1. **L1 â€“ Input & Identity**: Normalizes user actions and binds them to session context.
2. **L2 â€“ Model Compute**: Executes local models and streams tokens without blocking.
3. **L3 â€“ Orchestration & Energy**: Converts token streams into energy events and maintains state.
4. **L4 â€“ Contracts & Transport**: Carries events and commands over well-defined channels.
5. **L5 â€“ Visualization & UX**: Renders truth-backed visuals and exposes audit modes.

## Realâ€‘Time Data Flow

Events travel upward from computation to visualization and downward from user commands to models. The orchestrator batches updates so the UI can render at ~16â€¯ms intervals, applying backpressure when producers outpace consumers.

## Localâ€‘First Extensibility

The system defaults to local execution but allows opt-in satellite models for heavy tasks. Remote calls must honor the same contracts so higher layers remain agnostic to compute location.

## Auditability

Every visual element traces back to a structured event emitted by L3. An audit mode in L5 can reveal raw payloads, enabling reproducibility and scientific transparency.

## Integration Points

- **WF-FND-004 â€“ The Decipher**: Supplies the energy events that feed Layerâ€¯3.
- **WF-FND-005 â€“ The Orchestrator**: Consumes Layerâ€¯3 emissions and schedules frame execution.
- **WF-TECH-004 â€“ State Management**: Persists events and snapshots for audit and replay.
- **WF-UX-006 â€“ Energy Visualization**: Renders Layerâ€¯5 visuals based on event streams.

## Validation & Metrics

- **Frame cadence**: Orchestrated components must honor the 60â€¯Hz timing contract.
- **Latency budget**: Each layer processes within 16â€¯ms to avoid frame drops.
- **Integrity**: Every upward event contains the originating layer ID and timestamp.
- **Extensibility**: Optional remote compute must not exceed 5â€¯ms additional latency.
