# WF‑FND‑003 Poster Brief
- **Tagline:** "Five layers, one living system."
- **Problem:** Raw AI computation is opaque and hard to control.
- **Solution:** A strict five-layer stack that converts tokens into energy‑aware events and visuals at 60 Hz.
- **Why It Matters:** Clear boundaries enable auditability, local-first privacy and hardware scalability.
- **Call to Action:** Adopt the layer contracts and contribute diagrams or tests for new modules.
