# WF‑FND‑003 Layer Contract Test Specification

## Purpose
Validate that each architecture layer honors its responsibilities, timing budget and isolation guarantees.

## Test Cases

### 1. Frame Cadence
- **Input:** Simulate 120 frames with synthetic events.
- **Expected:** Processing time per frame ≤ 16.67 ms.

### 2. Layer Isolation
- **Scenario:** Inject malformed event attempting to bypass L3 and write directly to L5.
- **Expected:** Event rejected; security warning logged.

### 3. Satellite Compute Latency
- **Input:** Route 10 requests to a mock satellite model.
- **Expected:** Added latency ≤ 5 ms per request.

### 4. Audit Trail Integrity
- **Action:** Enable audit_mode and replay 50 events.
- **Expected:** Replayed sequence matches original timestamps and layer IDs.

### 5. Backpressure Handling
- **Input:** Burst of 200 token_events in a single frame.
- **Expected:** Lower-priority events dropped; system continues emitting at 60 Hz.
