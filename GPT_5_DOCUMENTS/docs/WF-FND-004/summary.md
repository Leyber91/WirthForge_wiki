# WF-FND-004 Summary

WF-FND-004 defines the Decipher, a 60â€¯Hz compiler that transforms raw model tokens into traceable energy events. Building on the vision, energy metaphor, and core architecture of earlier documents, it completes the foundation by specifying how real-time signals become visuals without compromising privacy.

The spec details the frame loop, emission schema, and local-first guarantees, preparing the path for system architecture and higher-level UX documents.
