# WF-FND-004: The Decipher (Central Compiler)

## Document Metadata
- **Document ID**: WF-FND-004
- **Title**: The Decipher (Central Compiler)
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: 2025-08-13
- **Status**: Draft
- **Dependencies**: WF-FND-001, WF-FND-002, WF-FND-003, WF-META-001
- **Enables**: WF-TECH-001, WF-TECH-004, WF-TECH-008, WF-UX-003

## Executive Summary
The Decipher is WIRTHFORGE's real-time energy compiler. It ingests token streams from Layerâ€‰â€“2, converts them into Energy Units, and emits structured events at a strict 60â€¯Hz cadence. By running locally and respecting privacy constraints, the Decipher translates invisible computation into synchronized visual feedback.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Token Ingestion** â€“ accept streaming output from the model layer without blocking.
2. **Energy Conversion** â€“ apply formulas from the Energy Metaphor to produce deterministic EU values.
3. **Frame Loop** â€“ operate on a 60â€¯Hz cycle, ensuring all processing completes within 16.67â€¯ms.
4. **Event Emission** â€“ output JSON/MessagePack events defined in [`schemas/WF-FND-004-emission.json`](../../schemas/WF-FND-004-emission.json).

## Frame Loop
Decipher maintains an internal timer aligned to the system timing contract in WF-META-001. On each tick it consumes queued tokens, updates energy state, and dispatches an event if any change occurred. Heavy computations may be split across frames to avoid drops.

## Privacy & Local-First
All processing occurs on the user's machine by default. Only abstracted energy metrics are emitted, never raw user content. Optional remote acceleration is additive and cannot bypass privacy guarantees.

## Implementation Details

- **Buffering**: Tokens accumulate in a ring buffer sized for 500â€¯ms of output.
- **Conversion**: Each token maps to energy units using WF-FND-002 formulas.
- **Emission**: Events include `frame`, `energy`, `payload`, and optional `meta` fields.

## Integration Points

- **WF-FND-003 Architecture**: Supplies timing contracts and layer boundaries.
- **WF-FND-005 Orchestrator**: Consumes emitted events and schedules downstream frames.
- **WF-TECH-004 State Store**: Persists emission history for replay and audit.

## Validation & Metrics

- **60â€¯Hz fidelity**: No frame may exceed 16.67â€¯ms processing time.
- **Energy accuracy**: Conversion error must remain <0.1â€¯EU per token.
- **Backpressure**: Buffer cannot exceed 80â€¯% capacity under normal workloads.

## ðŸŽ¨ Required Deliverables

- [x] Decipher specification (this document)
- [x] Executive summary
- [x] Sequence diagram â€“ `assets/diagrams/WF-FND-004-sequence.mmd`
- [x] Emission schema â€“ `schemas/WF-FND-004-emission.json`
- [x] Emission contract test â€“ `tests/WF-FND-004/emission-contract.spec.js`
- [x] Version control changelog

## âœ… Quality Validation Criteria

- **Determinism**: Identical token streams produce identical energy events.
- **Isolation**: Decipher never writes to external storage directly.
- **Safety**: Emissions are bounded and validated against the schema.

## Postâ€‘Generation Notes

Further iterations may explore adaptive buffering and hardware acceleration paths.

## Sequence Diagram
A high-level interaction is illustrated in [`assets/diagrams/WF-FND-004-sequence.mmd`](../../assets/diagrams/WF-FND-004-sequence.mmd).

## Future Work
- Integrate higher-order resonance detection once UX level 4 is active.
- Benchmark additional model backends for low-power hardware tiers.
