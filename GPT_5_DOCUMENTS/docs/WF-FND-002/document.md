# WF-FND-002 – Output Physics & Progressive Levels

## Document DNA & Dependencies
- **Document ID**: WF-FND-002
- **Priority**: P1
- **Version**: 1.1.0
- **Authors**: Architecture Guild, Product Guild
- **Status**: Active
- **Parent Docs**: WF-FND-001
- **Child Docs**: WF-TECH-005, WF-UX-001, WF-UX-010, WF-TECH-013
- **Dependencies**: WF-FND-001, WF-META-001

## Core Objective & Rationale
WIRTHFORGE renders model cognition as light and motion. This document defines the
"output physics" that ties every photon to measurable computation and describes
the progressive five‑level system that gradually unlocks orchestration
capabilities. The rationale is to ensure scientific honesty, local‑first privacy
and deterministic visual behavior across hardware tiers.

## Knowledge Integration Checklist
- [x] WF-FND-001 – Vision & principles
- [x] Broker architecture notes
- [x] Root‑level energy definition
- [ ] New definitions introduced here:
  - **Energy E(t)** – normalized, smoothed function of cadence, certainty and stall
  - **Progressive Level** – user capability tier unlocked by verified energy telemetry

## Content Architecture
### Executive Summary
Output Physics maps real token telemetry (timing, probability distribution,
model identity) to visual metaphors. A deterministic state machine converts
these signals into an energy value that drives the five progressive levels of
the system.

### Core Concepts & Definitions
- **Signals measured**: inter‑arrival time, token probability, stall duration
- **Energy function** `E(t) = w1·cadence + w2·certainty + w3·(1‑stall)`
- **Levels 1‑5**: Lightning, Streams, Structure, Fields, Resonance

### Implementation Details
- Ollama integration for per‑token telemetry
- Broker distributes work to satellite models while preserving local‑first
  guarantees
- 60 Hz rendering loop with backpressure strategies for low‑spec devices

### Integration Points
- Emits WVMP v0.1 metrics for other FND and TECH docs
- Shares energy state with orchestrator and governance layers
- Provides schema for broker telemetry and event emission

### Validation & Metrics
- Unit tests confirm `0 ≤ E(t) ≤ 1`
- Frame loop validated at 60 Hz under simulated load
- Telemetry schemas validated against sample broker payloads

### Future Work
- Tune default weights for diverse model families
- Expand interference visuals for >2 model streams
- Formalize level progression API for external orchestrators

### Required Deliverables
- `document.md` (this file)
- `summary.md`
- `poster-brief.md`
- `glossary-delta.md`
- Energy function schema and sample code
- Telemetry example payloads
- Tests for energy normalization and level progression
