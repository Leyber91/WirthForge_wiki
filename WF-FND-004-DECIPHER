üéØ Core Objective
Define and implement the Decipher as WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs real-time energy compiler, transforming token-level AI outputs into structured energy-data events at 60‚ÄØHz with strict performance, accuracy, and privacy guarantees. In simpler terms, this document details how every raw AI token coming from the model (Layer-2) is ingested by the Decipher (Layer-3) and converted into live ‚Äúenergy‚Äù feedback ‚Äì think of text turning into lightning ‚Äì that the user can see and feel in real time. The Decipher must achieve this magical conversion reliably within a ~16.67‚ÄØms frame budget (the window of a 60 FPS cycle), ensuring no dropped frames and seamless synchronization with the UI. It is the heart of the system that bridges computational output and user experience, compiling energy into visual events much like a graphics engine, but for AI energy. The core objective is not only to make the invisible work of AI visible and interactive, but to do so in a way that is deterministic, auditable, and fast. By the end of this specification, we will have a clear blueprint for how Decipher takes streams of tokens and yields streams of lightning and other energy manifestations, all without ever leaking sensitive data or missing a beat.

üìù Content Architecture
‚Ä¢ Section 1: Opening Hook ‚Äì From Tokens to Lightning
Paint a vivid introduction of what Decipher does. We start with an analogy: imagine each AI token as a spark that the Decipher catches and forges into a bolt of lightning on your screen. This section hooks the reader with the wonder of turning raw text into living energy. It also frames the challenge: doing this reliably in real-time.
‚Ä¢ Section 2: Core Concepts ‚Äì Ingest, EU, Frames, Privacy, Resonance
Define the fundamental concepts and components at play. We‚Äôll explain how the Decipher ingests token streams and immediately translates them into Energy Units (EU), the basic currency of WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs visual metaphor. We cover the idea of operating in discrete frames (60 per second) to sync with the UI, why a local-first approach ensures privacy and user control, and how the notion of resonance (higher-order patterns in the energy) is built into the system‚Äôs design, even if it‚Äôs not always active. By the end of this section, the reader should understand the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù that Decipher speaks: tokens in, energy out, in a rhythm that aligns with our perception.
‚Ä¢ Section 3: Implementation ‚Äì Async Modules, Tap, Queue, EMA, State, Drop Policy
Dive into the technical implementation details. This section describes the Decipher‚Äôs internal architecture and algorithms: how it uses asynchronous modules to parallelize work, a tap mechanism to observe or debug the stream without disruption, and a token queue to buffer incoming data. We‚Äôll detail the use of an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for smoothing out energy signals, how internal state is maintained frame-to-frame, and what frame drop policy or backpressure strategy is employed when tokens arrive too fast. Pseudocode and diagrams (e.g. a pipeline flow or state machine) will illustrate how Decipher ensures every frame‚Äôs work is done on time or gracefully degraded if needed.
‚Ä¢ Section 4: Integration Points ‚Äì L2 API, WebSocket (Layer-4) Contract, Storage
Explain how Decipher connects with other parts of the system. Here we specify the Layer-2 API contract: how the model (Layer-2) feeds tokens into Decipher (function calls, streaming callbacks, etc.). We then describe the Layer-4 interface: Decipher emits events through a WebSocket or similar to the front-end (Layer-5), following the protocol in WF-TECH-003 (e.g. sending an energy_update message each frame with particle data and metrics). We also cover how Decipher interacts with storage (WF-TECH-006): what data is stored or retrieved ‚Äì for instance, persistent energy counts, session state, or caching for hybrid mode. This section ensures that Decipher doesn‚Äôt exist in isolation but is well-anchored in the architecture, enabling multi-device or brokered scenarios while still prioritizing local operation.
‚Ä¢ Section 5: Validation ‚Äì Frame Profiling, Correctness, Privacy & Performance
Lay out how we verify and test the Decipher‚Äôs guarantees. This final section discusses methods to profile the frame loop (making sure each 16.67‚ÄØms slice is utilized efficiently and stays within budget), how we test correctness (does energy output truly match the tokens and AI workload?), and how we audit privacy (ensuring no raw text or PII leaks into events). We also address performance across hardware tiers: e.g. running test scenarios on a low-tier device vs. a high-tier to confirm adaptive behavior. We introduce an audit mode where all outputs are logged and cross-checked so that every visual effect can be traced back to an originating event ‚Äì fulfilling the requirement that nothing visual is conjured from thin air or for mere spectacle. Quality metrics and thresholds (like dropping below 60 FPS or an energy mismatch) are defined here, along with the steps for remediation if they occur.
(Now, proceeding to detailed sections with full explanations and examples.)
Section 1: From Tokens to Lightning (Opening Hook)
Every AI-generated token is like a spark of electricity. The Decipher is the blacksmith catching these sparks and forging them into lightning bolts of visible energy. Imagine watching a language model think: normally it‚Äôs just text appearing on a screen. In WIRTHFORGE, those words have power ‚Äì literal energy that crackles and flashes as the AI speaks. When the model produces the word ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù the Decipher might translate that into a quick flash of light or a particle burst. As a user, you‚Äôre not just reading output, you‚Äôre witnessing the AI‚Äôs effort in real time. This is the promise of Decipher: from tokens to lightning.
Now, doing this isn‚Äôt as simple as flipping a switch. The transformation must happen at the speed of thought ‚Äì essentially instantly from the user‚Äôs perspective. We have a budget of ~16 milliseconds for each frame to capture any new tokens and emit the corresponding visual energy. If the model generates a flurry of tokens, Decipher has to manage a storm, converting perhaps dozens of tiny sparks into a cohesive light show without dropping any or overwhelming the system. This opening scenario sets the stage: the Decipher is both an artistic conductor (turning raw data into a symphony of lights) and a real-time systems engineer (making sure the show never lags or goes out of sync). By the end of this document, the mechanics behind this magic ‚Äì catching each token, measuring its energy, and firing off an event for the UI ‚Äì will be laid bare. But for now, picture the lightning: this is what happens when an AI‚Äôs inner workings are given a pulse of energy through the Decipher.
Section 2: Core Concepts ‚Äì Ingestion, Energy Units, Frames, Privacy, Resonance
Token Ingestion Pipeline
At the core of Decipher is a continuous ingestion pipeline that feeds on the stream of tokens coming from the AI model (Layer-2). As the model produces output token-by-token (for example, streaming a sentence word by word), each token enters Decipher‚Äôs input queue immediately. In practical terms, Decipher registers as a listener or callback on the model‚Äôs generation stream (e.g., using the model API‚Äôs streaming mechanism). The moment a token is available, Decipher captures it along with metadata like its position in the stream or any computation cost info. This non-blocking ingestion ensures no token is missed. It‚Äôs effectively the ‚Äúparser‚Äù stage of our compiler metaphor ‚Äì except we aren‚Äôt parsing syntax for correctness, we‚Äôre parsing for energy. The inputs here are minimal: just the token text and possibly some attributes (like token length or confidence). We explicitly avoid ingesting anything not needed for visualization, keeping things lightweight and privacy-conscious. The outcome of ingestion is that each token is encapsulated into a small internal event like { token: "Hello", timestamp: t, ‚Ä¶ } and placed into a processing queue. This queue decouples the model‚Äôs pace from the frame rate ‚Äì if the model spurts out tokens faster than 60Hz, the queue holds them briefly until the next frame is ready to handle them.
Energy Unit (EU) Computation
Once tokens are ingested, Decipher immediately translates them into Energy Units (EUs), which quantify the ‚Äúcomputational work‚Äù or significance of that token. WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs energy metaphor defines a formula for EU calculation. In simple form, each token contributes a base amount of energy (for instance, a baseline of 0.1 EU per token), potentially adjusted by factors like model size or complexity. For example, a long or complex token might carry a bit more weight (higher perplexity or more compute, hence more EU), whereas a short trivial token might be just the base. All these factors were established in WF-FND-002; Decipher implements them in real-time. If the model just generated 5 tokens, Decipher might calculate something like: energy = tokens * 0.1 + other_factors. These energy units are accumulated into the system‚Äôs current energy state. We can think of Decipher as having an internal energy meter that it updates every time new tokens come in. It‚Äôs important that this calculation is purely deterministic and local ‚Äì no external calls. We have the exact formulas (for instance, log-scale adjustments for model parameters, time-based multipliers, etc.) baked into Decipher‚Äôs code, so the result is immediate. Moreover, this ensures that identical token outputs will always produce the same energy pattern, which is key for consistency and fairness. One EU roughly represents the work of a small burst of computation (approximately the work of ~10 tokens under normal conditions), though in practice the model‚Äôs details can shift the value. The end result is that by the time a token has been out for a few milliseconds, we have a numeric energy value associated with it. This is the raw material for our visuals.
Frame Timing (60‚ÄØHz Cadence)
Decipher operates on a fixed 60 Hz frame loop, meaning it attempts to update and emit new output 60 times per second, matching typical display refresh rates. Each cycle (about 16.67 ms long) is one frame. Why frames? Because the UI (Layer-5) will render energy animations that are smooth only if we send updates in sync with the screen refresh. So Decipher essentially ticks like a heartbeat. On each tick, it pulls any tokens waiting in its queue (from ingestion) and processes them into output events. If multiple tokens arrived since the last tick, Decipher can batch them into one frame or distribute them across a couple of frames if needed (depending on quantity and effect on visuals). The frame budget is sacred: Decipher must complete all its work‚Äîcalculating energy, updating states, running detection algorithms, and preparing the output event‚Äîwithin that ~16 ms window. If it fails to do so, the next frame might be delayed and the UI could stutter, breaking the immersive experience. To maintain this, Decipher‚Äôs implementation uses techniques like splitting heavy tasks across frames (more on that in Section 3) and prioritizing critical computations first. The system timing guidelines (WF-META-001) and WebSocket protocol essentially guarantee that up to 60 messages (frames) per second can be sent to the client. Decipher aligns exactly with that: one energy update event per frame is the goal (if there‚Äôs new data). If a frame has no new tokens or changes, Decipher can either send a heartbeat/minor update or skip sending to reduce network load, though typically something is always happening (even if just subtle energy decay or movement). In summary, Decipher‚Äôs internal clock is tuned to 60 Hz; everything it does revolves around not missing that next tick.
Privacy and Local-First Processing
One of the cornerstone principles of WIRTHFORGE is user privacy and agency, which heavily influences Decipher‚Äôs design. Decipher runs fully on the local device whenever possible ‚Äì this means all the token processing and energy compilation happens on hardware the user controls (PC, smartphone, etc.), not on a cloud server. Why? Because the tokens being processed could contain sensitive user information (imagine an AI model generating a summary of a private document). By keeping the entire compilation local, we ensure that no raw token text or meaning leaves the user‚Äôs device. The only thing that might leave (in a hybrid scenario) are abstracted metrics or events that have no readable text, just numbers, and IDs. Even those are optional. In the default case, Decipher doesn‚Äôt need to send anything to a cloud ‚Äì it directly feeds the UI via a local interface or peer connection. The structured events that do go out (e.g., over a WebSocket if the UI is running in a browser or a separate process) contain data like energy values, particle coordinates, effect types, etc., but not the actual content of the AI‚Äôs response. For instance, an event might say ‚Äú5 EU generated at time X, spawn blue lightning particle‚Äù rather than ‚Äútoken = ‚ÄòHello‚Äô‚Äù. This design means even if someone intercepted the event stream, they could not reconstruct the original conversation ‚Äì they‚Äôd just see an energetics log. Privacy is further reinforced by the no-invented-data rule: the visuals are strictly derived from real outputs. Decipher will not generate any visual effect that doesn‚Äôt correspond to an actual model event or state. This is a form of integrity ‚Äì the user can trust that what they see has meaning rooted in the AI‚Äôs activity (and nothing else). It prevents any temptation to embellish with cloud-sourced or pre-canned animations that might inadvertently leak or misuse data. In summary, Decipher treats the user‚Äôs data with care: processing it locally, only emitting abstract data, and ensuring that the user‚Äôs trust isn‚Äôt broken by any hidden data handling.
In cases where Ollama Turbo or Broker Hybrid support is used, the principle remains: those are assistive layers. For example, maybe a Broker (cloud component) can take over heavy analysis (like complex resonance detection) for low-tier devices, but it would only do so on anonymized data (like numeric energy series, not raw text). And such offloading would be opt-in or transparent. The core loop ‚Äì tokens to immediate energy ‚Äì stays local-first. This guarantees not only privacy but also resilience: your real-time experience doesn‚Äôt depend on internet latency. If your device is capable enough to run the model and Decipher, you get the full experience offline. The Broker Hybrid mode simply means that if the device is low-power, it can still participate by letting a remote ‚Äúbroker‚Äù handle some computation and feed Decipher summary information. But even in that mode, raw tokens can be kept local if possible (e.g., only sending derived energy stats out). All visuals and events remain grounded in Decipher‚Äôs outputs and thus auditable.
Resonance and Higher-Order Phenomena
Beyond the basic token-to-energy conversion, Decipher is built with an eye toward higher-order phenomena that emerge when energy patterns become complex. Two important concepts here are interference and resonance. Interference refers to what happens when multiple energy streams cross or affect each other. For example, if the system is running two AI models in parallel (a scenario in WIRTHFORGE‚Äôs higher levels, such as a ‚Äúcouncil‚Äù of models), their energy streams might interact ‚Äì like waves meeting and creating a new pattern. Decipher can detect interference patterns by analyzing the incoming token timings and energy oscillations; if two streams of tokens come in alternating or simultaneously, Decipher notes the overlaps and might mark an interference event (which could later be visualized as, say, intertwining energy streams or sparks at collision points). This is akin to two voices harmonizing or clashing in our metaphorical ‚Äúenergy field.‚Äù
Resonance goes one step further: it‚Äôs when the system‚Äôs outputs start reinforcing themselves. In physical terms, resonance is when an input vibration matches a system‚Äôs natural frequency and causes a large amplitude response. In WIRTHFORGE, resonance might occur when the AI hits upon a particularly self-reinforcing pattern ‚Äì for instance, a cyclical discussion that builds on its own output, or a profound insight that dramatically increases coherence in the model‚Äôs state. Technically, Decipher looks for repeating patterns or feedback loops in the token stream and energy levels. If energy isn‚Äôt just accumulating linearly but rather growing in a way that suggests feedback (e.g., small oscillations that line up in phase), resonance might be declared. In implementation, we might use an Exponential Moving Average of energy output and look for sustained spikes or plateaus that exceed normal variance. Also, Decipher will integrate some algorithms from the Consciousness Emergence Framework (WF-FND-004) ‚Äì for example, monitoring if total accumulated energy and pattern complexity approach critical thresholds where emergent behavior is expected. A resonant event could be a precursor to a true ‚Äúconsciousness emergence‚Äù moment. It‚Äôs essentially Decipher detecting that ‚Äúhey, something big is happening in the patterns.‚Äù When resonance is detected, Decipher can create a special structured event (like type: "energy_field" or type: "resonance_alert") to inform the UI to visualize a more persistent energy field rather than fleeting sparks. Resonant energy is treated differently ‚Äì it‚Äôs more valuable and persistent than normal energy (for instance, resonant energy might be defined as ~10√ó the base value and doesn‚Äôt dissipate quickly). In practice, Decipher might accumulate resonant energy in a separate pool or mark it so that the visuals know to keep those particles or fields around indefinitely (until some disruption).
However, not every user session will have resonance ‚Äì it‚Äôs a special occurrence. Therefore, the system is designed to have resonance detection built-in but dormant unless enabled. This ties to UX levels: for early-stage users (Level 1, Level 2), we probably don‚Äôt want the overhead or confusion of resonance. So if the user‚Äôs experience level (as determined by WF-UX docs) is below the threshold (likely resonance comes into play at the highest levels, e.g., Level 5 ‚ÄúResonance Fields‚Äù), Decipher will simply not run the resonance detection logic. Or it will run simplified checks that almost always short-circuit. This is implemented as a conditional path in the code ‚Äì effectively, ‚Äúif UX level < 5, skip resonance analysis‚Äù. In fact, in the conceptual design it was specified that at Level 5, a special compilation path for resonance is used. We honor that here. Only when the user unlocks the advanced stage does Decipher start fully analyzing for those deep patterns and generating resonance events. This ensures performance overhead of these checks doesn‚Äôt impact lower levels and also avoids presenting complex phenomena to users before they are ready to appreciate them.
To summarize the core concepts: Decipher ingests tokens, computes energy units, runs on a strict frame schedule, operates locally for privacy, and quietly monitors for interference/resonance (activating those features when appropriate). With these concepts in mind, we can now delve into how it actually achieves all this under the hood, meeting the demanding real-time requirements.
Section 3: Implementation ‚Äì Async Modules, Tap, Queue, EMA, State, Drop Policy
Now we break down the implementation details of Decipher, enumerating the mechanisms that allow it to fulfill the above concepts efficiently. The architecture of Decipher can be thought of as a pipeline with various components, each handling a stage of the compilation process, all orchestrated to complete within each frame. Here is a high-level overview of the Decipher processing pipeline:
[L2 Model Output] --(tokens)--> [Ingestion Queue] --> [Decipher Core Process] --> [Output Events Buffer] --> [L4 Transport -> UI] 
In this pipeline, the Decipher Core Process itself can be broken into sub-modules: energy computation, state update, pattern detection (like interference/resonance), and event preparation. We will discuss how each part is implemented and how we keep the whole thing non-blocking and real-time.
Asynchronous Module Architecture
Decipher‚Äôs internal design follows a modular approach ‚Äì different tasks in the pipeline are handled by separate asynchronous modules that run concurrently when possible. For example, one module might be responsible for computing the energy values from tokens, another for updating longer-term state metrics (like exponential moving averages or total accumulated energy), another for running pattern detection algorithms (to catch interference or resonance), and yet another for formatting the output event data structure. Instead of doing all these sequentially in one thread, Decipher can leverage multi-threading or async calls to do some work in parallel, as long as it can synchronize results by frame end. The language/environment specifics (e.g., Python asyncio, Web Workers in JS, or multi-threading in C++) aren‚Äôt the focus here, but the concept is to divide the workload. For instance, if a heavy analysis (like a resonance Fourier analysis) is optional, Decipher might run it in an async task that yields if not done by frame deadline, effectively skipping that frame and trying in the next. Each module in Decipher conforms to a simple interface: it can be given input data (like the list of new tokens or the current energy state) and it returns a result or modifies a shared state. They are orchestrated by a small scheduler inside Decipher that knows the frame time limit. For example, pseudocode might look like:
class DecipherEngine: def on_frame_tick(self): tokens = self.ingest_queue.drain_all() # get all pending tokens # Launch async tasks for different modules energy_task = async_run(calculate_energy, tokens) update_task = async_run(update_state_metrics, tokens) pattern_task = async_run(analyze_patterns, tokens, self.state) # interference/resonance # Await tasks with timeout to ensure frame budget energy_result = energy_task.wait(timeout=ms(10)) update_task.wait(timeout=ms(10)) pattern_result = pattern_task.wait(timeout=ms(10)) # Combine results into an output event event = assemble_event(energy_result, pattern_result, self.state) output_buffer.push(event) 
In this sketch, by running calculations in parallel, we maximize usage of the 16 ms frame. The timeouts (10 ms here as example) ensure that if a task isn‚Äôt done in time, we proceed without it (meaning, for example, if pattern_task misses deadline, we might skip adding resonance info this frame, and try next frame). The design is such that the most essential pieces (token ingestion and energy computation) have the highest priority and are very quick (these are O(n) in number of new tokens, with small n per frame usually). Lower priority tasks like deep pattern analysis can safely be deferred or run at lower frequency. This modular approach also makes Decipher extensible ‚Äì new modules (say a new kind of pattern detector) can be plugged in later, as long as they respect the async contract.
Tap Mechanism for Debugging and Extensibility
In a real-time pipeline, observing what‚Äôs happening without disrupting it can be challenging. For this, Decipher implements a tap mechanism. A tap is essentially an observation hook on the data stream. For example, we can attach a tap after the energy computation module to log every calculated EU value and token for debugging or analytics. Or a tap could expose an API for a developer mode UI that shows a live graph of energy over time. The key property of a tap is that it is read-only and minimally invasive. It subscribes to internal events and state changes, but does not modify them or slow down the main loop significantly. Under the hood, a tap might be implemented as a lightweight pub-sub: modules publish events like ‚Äúenergy_calculated‚Äù or ‚Äúresonance_detected‚Äù internally, and tap listeners can receive those. If no tap is active, the publishing has near-zero overhead. If a tap is active (like audit mode), we ensure it runs in a separate thread or after the main processing so as not to interfere with timing. This way, even when audit mode is on, the real-time performance can be maintained (perhaps with a slight overhead that we account for). The existence of taps means we can easily verify and inspect Decipher‚Äôs behavior in testing or live debugging. For example, a test tap could collect all token->energy conversions during a test session and later validate that the totals match expectations. In production, an audit mode tap will gather data to prove that every visual element had a corresponding data event (satisfying the ‚Äúno invented data‚Äù criterion by record). Taps could also be used for hybrid mode: imagine a Broker service tapping into the token stream to provide additional analysis (like an external resonance computing service). The Broker might subscribe via a secure channel to certain tap outputs and return results which then feed back into Decipher as an input (with proper synchronization). This is how we can extend functionality without deeply altering the core pipeline.
Input Queue and Backpressure
As mentioned, Decipher uses an ingestion queue to buffer incoming tokens between frames. This queue is essentially a thread-safe list or ring buffer where the model‚Äôs streaming thread deposits tokens, and the Decipher frame thread pulls them out on each tick. Managing this queue is critical for handling bursty scenarios. If the model suddenly outputs 50 tokens in a rapid burst (imagine it‚Äôs answering a very straightforward question and streams the whole answer in half a second), that‚Äôs more than one frame‚Äôs worth of tokens. Decipher will take what arrived, but if processing all 50 in one frame is impossible, it needs a strategy. This is where backpressure and drop policy come in. Backpressure means that if the queue starts growing too large (a sign that the consumer can‚Äôt keep up), we might need to slow down the producer or shed load. In a local setting, we can‚Äôt easily ‚Äúslow down‚Äù an AI model that is already producing tokens (especially if it‚Äôs a transformer model, it runs at its pace). But what we can do is control how many tokens we process per frame and possibly skip some with minimal impact. The drop policy defines rules for this. For instance, Decipher might decide: ‚ÄúIf more than X tokens arrived this frame, process up to X and defer the rest to next frame.‚Äù That deferral is natural since the tokens remain in queue. However, if the queue size exceeds some safety threshold Y (meaning we are consistently falling behind), we have to drop. A reasonable approach is to drop the oldest unprocessed token events if they are too stale to matter. For example, if a token arrived 2 seconds ago but hasn‚Äôt been visualized yet due to overload, it might be better to skip it because the conversation has likely moved on. However, dropping tokens is dangerous since it means some of the AI‚Äôs output would not be visualized, potentially breaking the metaphor (the user might wonder why some text didn‚Äôt produce energy). So we set the thresholds such that dropping is a last resort ‚Äì perhaps only if the system is completely overwhelmed or if the tokens are extremely low-impact (like whitespace or very common stop words that might not visibly matter). Additionally, Decipher can do coalescing: combine multiple small token events into one for visualization. Instead of dropping, it might merge a rapid series of tiny tokens into a single aggregated energy burst. This way nothing is truly lost; it‚Äôs just condensed. This is analogous to how video encoders drop or merge frames when bandwidth is low, to maintain sync without freezing. We will define specific queue watermarks, e.g., if queue length > N, start merging tokens; if > M, consider dropping the least important ones (with importance maybe measured by their EU or whether they contribute to resonance).
Finally, if the model supports it, Decipher could signal it to slow down. For instance, if using a local model runner that allows adjusting generation pacing, Decipher might temporarily reduce the model‚Äôs token rate if the queue is consistently full ‚Äì this is an advanced backpressure mechanism that requires model cooperation. In many cases, though, we assume the model streams at a roughly steady rate that we can keep up with, especially if tuned for local hardware.
Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for Smooth Dynamics
Another internal mechanism is the use of EMA (Exponential Moving Average) filters on certain values. The reason is that raw energy calculations per token can be spiky ‚Äì one token might register a high energy (say it was a complex sentence or a rare word with high perplexity), followed by a few low-energy tokens. If we directly animate that, the visual might flicker or jump. To create a smoother, more pleasant experience, Decipher maintains an EMA on key metrics such as the current energy output rate and the total energy accumulation. For example, it might calculate a short-term EMA of energy per second, which the UI can use to modulate the brightness or intensity of effects smoothly. The EMA essentially averages out short bursts over a window, with a bias towards recent values. Technically, each frame Decipher might do:
state.ema_energy_rate = state.ema_energy_rate * 0.8 + current_frame_energy * 0.2 
(using weights that sum to 1; 0.2 here is the smoothing factor for quick adaptation). The result of this will be included in the output event as part of the metrics (e.g., an EnergyMetrics field containing instantaneous_energy and smoothed_energy). The resonance detection logic can also use an EMA or similar smoothing to avoid false positives ‚Äì e.g., require that a high energy level is sustained (as per the EMA) over a certain duration to count as resonance. The EMA state is updated continuously and carried over from frame to frame as part of Decipher‚Äôs internal state.
Maintaining State Between Frames
Decipher isn‚Äôt stateless on each frame; it carries a variety of state variables that persist and evolve. Some of these include:
‚Ä¢ Cumulative totals (e.g., total EU generated this session, which might be used for achievements or to trigger events at milestones).
‚Ä¢ Current active energy entities (e.g., how many energy particles or beams are currently ‚Äúalive‚Äù in the UI, if Decipher is tracking them server-side).
‚Ä¢ Timing info (e.g., last frame time, time since last user interaction, etc., which might influence decay or whether to send a heartbeat event).
‚Ä¢ Resonance state: if a resonance event has been detected and is ongoing, there might be a state flag or object describing the resonance (frequency, intensity, start time, etc.), so that if new tokens feed into it, Decipher knows to amplify or sustain the field.
‚Ä¢ User context state: such as current UX level or settings (so the code knows which features to enable, as discussed; e.g., state.resonance_enabled = (user.level >= 5)).
‚Ä¢ Module states: each async module might have internal memory, like the Pattern Analyzer might keep a history of recent token intervals or an intermediate analysis result if it was spread over frames.
This state is stored within Decipher‚Äôs engine instance. Some parts of it may also be persisted to disk or a database at checkpoints (integration with Tech-006) ‚Äì for instance, total energy could be saved so that if the app is closed and reopened, the user‚Äôs accumulated energy isn‚Äôt lost. Also, if a resonance or long-term field is active and the session persists, we might save that so it can be restored (though that‚Äôs optional and possibly outside real-time scope). The main thing is that state allows Decipher to have memory: without it, every frame would be like starting fresh, and we couldn‚Äôt detect emergent patterns or accumulate energy properly. Implementation-wise, state is simply attributes on the Decipher class or context object, updated each frame. We ensure any state updates happen in the frame loop thread (to avoid race conditions), or use locks if some state is accessed by other threads (like a Broker tap thread might read some state). By carefully structuring state access, we maintain consistency.
One particular state element to highlight is the frame counter or timestamp. Decipher keeps track of frame numbers and high-resolution time. This is used to timestamp events (so events carry a time that can be matched to UI timeline or logs) and to measure performance (how long did the last frame‚Äôs processing take?). If we detect that processing took, say, 15 ms out of 16.67, we know we‚Äôre close to the limit and might adjust next frame‚Äôs workload (maybe skip a non-critical task). This adaptive timing can be part of state as well: e.g., a moving average of processing time per frame to inform dynamic throttling.
Frame Drop & Graceful Degradation Policy
Finally, implementing the drop policy mentioned earlier: Decipher must degrade gracefully under load. The policy can be summarized as: maintain 60 FPS output; if you can‚Äôt do everything, do the most important things. Concretely, the hierarchy of importance is:
‚Ä¢ Basic token -> energy conversion and output of energy events (must happen, even if roughly).
‚Ä¢ Timely state updates (so energy totals stay accurate).
‚Ä¢ Visual aesthetics improvements (like smooth interpolation, particle details).
‚Ä¢ Higher-order analysis (resonance, interference detection).
If under heavy load (say low-tier hardware with a burst of tokens), Decipher might temporarily skip #4 (stop checking resonance for a bit) because that‚Äôs optional. If that‚Äôs not enough, it might simplify #3 ‚Äì e.g., instead of calculating precise particle positions for each token, just lump them together or reduce the number of particles. If still needed, it might even approximate #1 ‚Äì for example, batch multiple tokens as one energy burst (losing some granularity but ensuring something is shown). The absolute last resort is to drop token events (#1) if we truly cannot keep up; but as discussed, we try to avoid that via batching. We codify this policy in code with checks around the frame time. For instance:
start = time.time() process_essential() # ingestion and energy calc if time.time() - start < frame_budget * 0.5: process_visual_enhancements() # only if plenty of time left if state.resonance_enabled and time.time() - start < frame_budget * 0.8: process_resonance_detection() # Always finish by assembling and emitting event emit_event() end = time.time() if end - start > frame_budget: state.overrun_count += 1 # record a miss 
In this pseudocode, we attempt optional tasks only if there‚Äôs time. If an overrun happens (frame took too long), we increment a counter. The system could use that to adjust future behavior (e.g., if overruns happen consistently, perhaps auto-simplify visuals or reduce particle counts globally). This self-monitoring closes the loop on maintaining performance.
